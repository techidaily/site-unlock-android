Nothing could be more frustrating than gazing at your phone, knowing that it is essentially a paperweight at this point. Unless you can get it unlocked, your phone is useless, and all of your important photos, text messages, and content are all locked out of your reach. While right now, nothing can do without a Google account. But you can try to reset your Google account first.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)"></a>Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)</h2><p>Even if you have a Google account, if your phone isn’t connected to the internet, you cannot access it to unlock your phone. If this sounds familiar, you can always try this method.</p><p>1. First, navigate to the Android Device Manager page. You will need to sign in with the Google account that you use to set up your phone.</p><p>Android Device Manager link: <a class="link"   href="http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager" >http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942446007.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager log in"                ></p><p>2. Once you have logged in, you will automatically be redirected to the Android Device Manager page. If this is your first time, click the “Accept” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942473262.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager start"                ></p><p>3. A list of all of the Honor 100 Pro devices registered to this Android account will pop up. Select the Honor 100 Pro device in question from this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942503282.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager list of devices"                ></p><p>4. The Android Device Manager will then locate your device. Make sure it is turned on!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942532352.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager locating device"                ></p><p>5. After it has been located, you will have a few options for what to do next. If you do not know your phone’s location, you can call it from this screen, but if you know where it is, click the ‘Enable Lock &amp; Erase’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942568385.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager device located"                ></p><p>6. A notification will pop up on your device; confirm it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942582896.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager Erase &amp; Lock"                ></p><p>7. At this point, you will be asked to create a new lock screen password. Once you have chosen one, press “Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637943377629.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager New Lock Screen"                ></p><p>8. Now, simply enter the new passcode on your device, and voila! It will open, and you can get back to your daily routine.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone"></a>Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone</h2><p>If you have forgotten your Google Account password, it is still possible to unlock your account and access the information within. Here is how you can unlock your Google account on your Android phone.</p><p>1. On your browser, go to the Google home page and try to sign in. You will fail, but that is good! It will lead you to the next step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535742329.jpg"                      alt="android Google web page"                ></p><p>2. Since you cannot sign in on the sign-in page, you can now select the ‘Help’ link.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535763672.jpg"                      alt="android Goodle log in"                ></p><p>3. Choose the “forgot password” option. You will be prompted to enter your email address to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535788151.jpg"                      alt="android Google trouble signing in"                ></p><p>4. Two options will then appear: the first is your phone number, and the other asks you for your backup email.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535828239.jpg"                      alt="android Google forgot password"                ><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535857339.jpg"                      alt="android Google forgot pssword enter email"                ></p><p>5. Enter either one of these options, and you will receive a verification code via email, SMS, or a telephone call from an operator. If you have chosen to enter your backup email, at this point, you will receive detailed instructions on how to access the ‘reset password’ page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637561923476.jpg"                      alt="android Google automated call verification"                ><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637561995841.jpg"                      alt="android Google automated call verification"                ></p><p>6.

Users have reported of Honor 100 Pro phones refusing to work with different carriers.</p><p>The issue limits the smartphone’s functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Honor 100 Pro device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited.

It is, however, important to find a way to unlock the broken device so that you can gain access to your data and create a backup to restore to a new device.</p><p>In this article, we are going to look at a few simple ways you can unlock an Android device with a broken screen.</p><p><strong>Here is a video for you to learn how to unlock Android phone or access phone with broken screen:</strong></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KaWEiQhxBTQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Method-1-Using-Android-Debug-Bridge-ADB"><a href="#Method-1-Using-Android-Debug-Bridge-ADB" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Using Android Debug Bridge (ADB)"></a>Method 1: Using Android Debug Bridge (ADB)</h2><p>For this method, you will need your device and access to a PC. It is the most powerful method to unlock a broken Android device. It will however only work if you have enabled USB debugging on your android phone. If you haven’t, skip this method and see if method 2 or 3 might be of help.</p><p>ADB creates a bridge between the PC and your device which can then be used to unlock the Honor 70 Lite 5G device. Here’s how to use this bridge.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the Android SDK package on your PC. You can download it here: <a class="link"   href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" >http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Extract the ZIP file on your PC.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Download the necessary drivers for your device. The USB drivers for your device can be found on the manufacturer’s website.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Launch Command Prompt on your PC and change the location of the ADB file. Type in the following into Command Prompt; <em>cd C:&#x2F;android&#x2F;platform-tools</em></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Connect the Honor 70 Lite 5G device to your PC using USB cables. Enter the command “ ADB _device_” (without quotation marks). If your phone is recognized, you will see numbers in the Command Prompt message.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Type in the following two commands. You will need to type in the second one immediately after the first. Replace 1234 with your password.</p><p><em>ADB shell input text 1234</em><br><em>Shell input key event 66</em></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Your phone will now be unlocked and you can proceed to back up its contents.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/style/images/arrow_up.png"                      alt="arrow"                ></p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)"></a>Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)</h3><p>The Best Tool to Reset Phones Without Android Factory Reset Codes</p><ul><li>It enables your Android phones to get safe, simple, and trustful after reset.</li><li>It is still helpful even though you don’t know the OS version of your devices.</li><li>Everybody can handle it without any technical background.</li><li>Provide specific removal solutions to promise good success rate.</li></ul><p><strong>4,008,670</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Method-2-Using-a-USB-Mouse-and-the-On-the-Go-Adapter"><a href="#Method-2-Using-a-USB-Mouse-and-the-On-the-Go-Adapter" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using a USB Mouse and the On the Go Adapter"></a>Method 2: Using a USB Mouse and the On the Go Adapter</h2><p>This is a great solution if you don’t have USB debugging enabled on your device. You will need your device, an OTG adapter and a USB mouse. It involves connecting the Honor 70 Lite 5G device to the USB mouse using the OTG adapter. Check if your device can be connected to a USB mouse. You can find an OTG adapter online, they are relatively inexpensive and very useful.</p><p>Before we begin, it is a good idea to ensure your device is sufficiently charged because the Mouse may drain your battery.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect the Micro USB side of the OTG adapter to your device and then plug in the USB mouse to the adapter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531933625473.jpg"                      alt="connect broken screen android phone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As soon as the Honor 70 Lite 5G devices are connected, you will be able to see a pointer on your screen. You can then use the pointer to unlock the pattern or enter the Honor 70 Lite 5G device’s password lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531933791903.jpg"                      alt="unlock android with broken screen"                ></p><p>You can then go about backing up the contents of your device.</p><h2 id="Method-3-Using-your-Samsung-Account"><a href="#Method-3-Using-your-Samsung-Account" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using your Samsung Account"></a>Method 3: Using your Samsung Account</h2><p>This method is a reliable way to unlock a Samsung device that has a broken screen or is not working correctly. While it is highly effective you will need to have a Samsung account registered with your device. The problem is that not many Samsung device users have registered their devices with the service. If you are among the lucky few who have, here’s how to use your account to unlock your device.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the <a class="link"   href="https://findmymobile.samsung.com/login.do" >https://findmymobile.samsung.com/login.do <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your PC or any other device and log in with your account information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531933993021.jpg"                      alt="unlock android with broken screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select your device from the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You should see the option “Unlock my screen” on the sidebar. Click on it and you will get instructions on how to access your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531934188479.jpg"                      alt="unlock android using samsung account"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Being unable to unlock your device is never a good place to be. We hope one of the above solutions will work for you. You can then gain access to your device and back up the files and contacts. This way your life doesn’t have to be disrupted- you can just restore the backup on a new device or the old one once the screen is fixed.</p><h2 id="Best-Honor-70-Lite-5G-Pattern-Lock-Removal-Tools-Remove-Android-Pattern-Lock-Without-Losing-Data"><a href="#Best-Honor-70-Lite-5G-Pattern-Lock-Removal-Tools-Remove-Android-Pattern-Lock-Without-Losing-Data" class="headerlink" title="Best Honor 70 Lite 5G Pattern Lock Removal Tools: Remove Android Pattern Lock Without Losing Data"></a>Best Honor 70 Lite 5G Pattern Lock Removal Tools: Remove Android Pattern Lock Without Losing Data</h2><p>In the digital age, our smartphones have become an integral part of our lives.

Password cracking term refers to group of techniques used to get password from a data system.</p><p>Purpose and reason of password cracking includes gaining an unauthorized access to a computer system or it can be recovery of forgotten password. There might be another reason of using password cracking technique that is for testing password strength so hacker could not hack into system.</p><p>Password cracking is normally performed thought repetitive process in which computer applies different combinations of password till the exact match.</p><p><strong>Brute Force Password Cracking:</strong></p><p>Term brute force password cracking may also be referred as brute force attack. Brute force password cracking is respective process of guessing password, in this process software or tool creates a large number of password combinations. Basically it’s a trail-and-error technique used by software to obtain password information from system.</p><p>A brute force attack are normally used by hackers when there is no chance of taking advantage of encrypted system weakness or by security analysis experts to test an organization’s network security .This method of password cracking is very fast for short length passwords but for long length passwords <a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack" >dictionary attack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> technique is normally used.</p><p>Time taken by brute force password cracking software to crack password is normally depend upon speed of system and internet connection.</p><p><strong>GPU Password Cracking:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit" >GPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is graphics processing unit, sometimes also called visual processing unit. Before talking about GPU password cracking we must have some understanding about <a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function" >hashes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When user enter password the password information stored in form of computer hashes using the one-way hashing algorithm.</p><p>In this password cracking technique using GPU software take a password guess and look through hashing algorithm and compare it or match it with the existing hashes till the exact match.</p><p>GPU can perform mathematical functions in parallel as GPU have hundreds of core that gives massive advantage in cracking password. GPU is much faster than CPU so that’s the reason of using GPU instead of CPU.</p><p><strong>CUDA Password Cracking:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA" >CUDA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Compute Unified Device Architecture is a model for programming and a platform that perform computations in parallel, created by NVIDIA for graphic processing.</p><p>CUDA Password cracking includes cracking passwords using Graphics card which have GPU chip, GPU can perform mathematical functions in parallel so the speed of cracking password is faster than CPU.GPU have many 32bit chips on it that perform this operation very quickly.</p><p>We can easily access CUDA through libraries, directives and with the help of different programming languages that includes C, C++ and FORTRAN.</p><p><strong>Password Cracking Tools</strong></p><p>Given below is the list of Top10 Password cracking tools.</p><h2 id="1-Cain-and-Abel-Top-password-cracking-tool-for-Windows"><a href="#1-Cain-and-Abel-Top-password-cracking-tool-for-Windows" class="headerlink" title="1.

Here are these options:</p><ul><li>A Personal Identification Number (PIN) is a simple yet effective way to secure your phone. It’s a numeric code that you enter on the lock screen. Setting up a PIN is straightforward via the Honor 100 device’s security settings, and unlocking your phone is as easy as tapping in the correct sequence of numbers.</li><li>Similar to a PIN but potentially more secure due to the allowance of a longer combination of numbers and letters. A passcode is ideal for those who seek an extra layer of security. You set it up in the security settings and use it to unlock your phone just like a PIN but with the added complexity of alphanumeric characters.</li><li><strong>Face Unlock.Pixel’s Face Unlock</strong> uses advanced facial recognition software. It scans your face to grant access, offering a hands-free and quick way to unlock your Pixel. This feature can be activated in the security settings and requires a simple glance at your phone to unlock.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/google-pixel-7-unlock-02.jpg"                      alt="woman holding a Honor 100"                ></p><ul><li><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/google-pixel-frp-bypass.html"><strong><u><b>Fingerprint Unlock</b></u></strong></a><strong>.</strong> This method uses your unique fingerprint as a key. It’s fast, secure, and convenient. The Pixel 6a, 6, and 7 fingerprint scanners are actually under the display. Register your fingerprint in the settings, then touch the sensor to gain access.</li><li><strong>Pattern</strong>. If you prefer a more visual method, the <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mi-pattern-lock.html"><u>pattern lock</u></a>lets you draw a specific shape or pattern on the screen to unlock your phone. It’s a fun and interactive way to secure your device.

Whichever unlocking method you prefer, Google ensures that accessing your phone is secure and convenient. All you need to do is set up your preferred method in the Honor 100 device’s settings and use it to unlock your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-To-Do-if-You-Forgot-Your-Screen-Unlock-Method"><a href="#Part-2-What-To-Do-if-You-Forgot-Your-Screen-Unlock-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What To Do if You Forgot Your Screen Unlock Method"></a>Part 2: What To Do if You Forgot Your Screen Unlock Method</h2><p>Forgetting the screen unlock method on your Honor 100 , whether it’s a PIN, passcode, pattern, or encountering face or fingerprint recognition issues, can be a frustrating experience.

However, pattern locks are easy to crack, and today, we bring you all you want to know about pattern locks and how to create a <strong>hard pattern lock</strong>. Further to this, we also tell you how to move beyond pattern locks and what to do in case you forgot the hard pattern lock you just set and are unable to unlock your smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="creating more secure pattern locks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks"></a>Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks</h2><p>Pattern lock is an Android-only feature that makes it easy for users to have a modicum of security on their smartphones. Most users do not prefer using and remembering a PIN to unlock the smartphone. Creating a pattern makes it easier, somehow.</p><p>There is a 9-point grid on which you swipe your finger from point to point, in any direction, and when you take your finger off, that pattern you swiped becomes the key to unlock your smartphone.</p><p>Pattern locks were exceedingly common only a few years ago, and they are not recommended for use any longer due to concerns (mentioned later in the article).</p><h3 id="1-1-Popularity-and-Usage"><a href="#1-1-Popularity-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="1.1: Popularity and Usage"></a>1.1: Popularity and Usage</h3><p>Old habits die hard, or so they say, right? That’s because it is true. We are creatures of habit, and pattern locks have been around for a long, long time. We are accustomed to pattern locks. So, even with even easier technologies such as fingerprint recognition and face recognition, we tend to gravitate towards the familiar old pattern lock.</p><p>The only thing is, there is a reason why pattern locks are no longer the preferred option to use for unlocking your smartphones. As it happens, that reason is security, and it can be very easy for humans to take a swipe (pardon the pun) at your pattern lock. And guess what? The research conducted suggests that they would get it right with an unsettling accuracy.</p><h3 id="1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>With on-the-go lifestyles, our smartphones have become indispensable and contain some of the most sensitive aspects of our lives – IDs, credit and debit cards in digital wallets, photo and video memories, business documents – you name it, the smartphones have it, on the go. This has opened our lives up to the public at large, and if someone steals our smartphone or, best case, finds it, the only barrier preventing them from being privy to all that wealth of our sensitive information is that screen lock – the pattern lock that we set on our smartphones. That’s it – the single pattern lock stands between malicious actors and our data. You might be beginning to realize just how crazy this is.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There are two advantages to using pattern locks. One, they are better than nothing. Two, they are easy to use. And that’s about it. There is no third advantage to pattern locks. We might think we set a hard pattern lock that nobody could guess, but, as research proves, we might be thinking too low of human prowess.</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>Security, or rather, the lack of it, is the lone disadvantage of using a pattern lock. What good is a pattern lock that can be easily deciphered? Sure, they are easy to use, and they are better than not having anything, but would you really want to protect your life’s data with something that could be, as researchers found out, breached in under 5 attempts? We don’t think you do!</p><p>The research found that 64% of test subjects who were shown videos of people unlocking their phones could correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock, that too after viewing the video only once! That number shot up to 80% if they were allowed to see the video again. That is simply astounding and a nightmare for security. When it comes to PINs, only 11% could guess a 6-digit PIN after viewing the unlocking video once, and that number shot up to 27% when they could see the video two times.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)"></a>Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)</h2><p>Now, if you must continue using a pattern lock, let’s help you know how to create a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy to decipher as easy pattern locks.

Computer Science student, gave a presentation on pattern locks at DEFCON 23 and made a bold claim. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.”</p><p>She presented the following statistics to support her claim:</p><ul><li>- In her research, she found that 77% of people started with one of the 4 corners when creating a pattern lock.</li><li>- 44% of people started with the top-left dot and 15% with the top-right, while the bottom-left was preferred by 14% of her test subjects.</li><li>- People set 5-point pattern locks on average, and most users were content with a 4-point pattern.</li></ul><p>These are some of the most common pattern locks people create:</p><ul><li>- patterns in the shapes of alphabets,</li><li>- patterns in the shapes of numerals,</li><li>- patterns in any other simple shape, such as square, triangle, star, etc.</li></ul><p>To understand how this is a security nightmare, the possible combinations for a 4-point pattern are a measly 1624, whereas by adding just 1 more point to the pattern and creating a 5-point pattern, the number of possible combinations becomes 7152, an increase of 5528 combinations. In stark contrast, creating a 9-point pattern would give you over 140,000 possible combinations!</p><h3 id="2-2-How-to-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock"><a href="#2-2-How-to-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock" class="headerlink" title="2.2: How to Create a Hard Pattern Lock"></a>2.2: How to Create a Hard Pattern Lock</h3><p>Knowing what most people do when creating a pattern lock, it becomes easy to avoid those mistakes and instead create a hard pattern lock for oneself.</p><ul><li>- Do not start creating a pattern lock from any of the 4 corners of the grid.</li><li>- Never use your first initial as your pattern lock.</li><li>- Never use the shape of a numeral as your pattern lock.</li><li>- Use all 9 points on the grid to create your pattern lock, and contrary to popular belief, you can go over the connecting lines several times, creating a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy for people to decipher!</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Going-Beyond-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-3-Going-Beyond-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Going Beyond Pattern Locks"></a>Part 3: Going Beyond Pattern Locks</h2><p>You might think that now that you have set a hard pattern lock, you are good to go.

Using fingerprint recognition requires you to set a 6-digit PIN and then set a fingerprint to unlock your device. You can set additional fingerprints, too.</p><p>This way, your device is the most secure it can be today.

Here is how to unlock your Samsung device with Samsung Find My Mobile:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Access the Find My Mobile (SmartThings Find) website using either a computer or another mobile device. Sign in using the Samsung account details linked to the locked device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/unlock-android-device-1.jpg"                      alt="login into samsung find my"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After successfully logging in, locate the locked Samsung device.

Following are the steps you need to follow to use Safe Mode to unlock your Android device:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Initiating Safe Mode requires a simultaneous three-second press of the “Volume Down” and “Power” keys.

The reason is it will erase all data on your device, including apps, photos, and settings. However, it can be an effective way to regain access to your device when other methods have failed. Here’s how to do it:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your Samsung device and connect it to your computer. Now press and hold “Volume Up” and “Power” keys for a while. Release the keys once the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device enters Recovery Mode.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In Recovery Mode, use the Volume keys to navigate to “Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset” and select it with the “Power” key.

This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition  device, you’ll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here’s how to remove the operator lock on a Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition :</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “*#*#7378423#*#*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg"                      alt="dial the provided number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Carefully check the information provided on the screen.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. To prevent potential data loss from forgotten passwords or unexpected issues, take precautions. Safeguard your crucial data by creating backups, whether in the cloud or on an external storage device.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article guided all the possible ways available in 2024 to reset your Android lock screen password, such as using the Smart Lock, Google Find My, Samsung SmartThings, and Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

You just swipe your finger across to create an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> of your choosing and that’s it, it becomes your new screen lock. No more remembering tedious digits! So, why have these easy pattern locks become outdated, and why do people still continue to use them? Let’s take a dive and find out all about pattern locks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="creating more secure pattern locks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-Things-To-Know-About-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-I-Things-To-Know-About-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks"></a>Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks</h2><p>The first cellphone locks were 4-digit number locks. Then came 6-digit codes, and even alphanumeric ones. Pattern locks were all the rage a while ago. Though pattern locks continue to be used, they are not considered safe to use any longer. What is all that about? Here’s what you need to know about pattern locks, whether you are a seasoned pattern lock user or not.</p><h3 id="I-I-What-Are-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#I-I-What-Are-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?"></a>I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?</h3><p>Believe it or not, technology has advanced at such a rapid pace in the last two decades that you’d be forgiven if you don’t know what a pattern lock is, especially if you have only ever used iPhones, or Android phones in just the last few years.</p><p>Pattern locks are patterns you create on your smartphone and designate as a smartphone lock&#x2F; screen lock. There is a 9-point keypad of sorts, and you start swiping your finger from any point to any point for any which way you feel like. Android 13 allows a minimum of 4 points registered. They are easy to create, and easy to use, hence called easy pattern locks.</p><p>Pattern locks have only ever been offered on Android devices and were commonplace a few years ago until they were deemed not secure enough for use by modern standards because they were <em>easy</em> to figure out by malicious actors.</p><h3 id="I-II-Popularity-and-Usage"><a href="#I-II-Popularity-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="I.II: Popularity and Usage"></a>I.II: Popularity and Usage</h3><p>Pattern lock is a feature unique to Android and has been so since the start. Naturally, it is one of the preferred ways users have come to unlock their Android devices over the years. Even though modern Android smartphones come with fingerprint recognition and face recognition technologies, there exists a large subset of users still addicted to and acclimatized with the pattern lock feature, opting over fingerprint and face recognition.</p><p>There has been, however, research conducted into the safety and security offered by pattern lock in Android.</p><h3 id="I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>Modern smartphones very nearly contain the entirety of our lives; photo memories, video memories, important documents both financial and personal in nature, banking apps, ID and ATM&#x2F; credit cards in the “wallet” apps, and whatnot. A smartphone falling into the wrong hands could very nearly be used to devastate the rightful owner, both financially and otherwise. And this is not a claim out of thin air; spyware&#x2F; malware&#x2F; phishing attacks are on the rise around the world. Locking the smartphone, once considered optional and an unnecessary hassle, is now an absolute must.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There is no denying that using an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> to lock their smartphone seems enough for most users. Swiping your finger across your smartphone to unlock it feels not only cool and futuristic but safer and more secure than remembering and punching in digits. And, for the most part, it is true, given that 4-digit PINs can only have 10,000 unique combinations!</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>While very easy to use, security researchers and experts have come to agree that the feature is not in the least safe to use, and that is because of how people use the pattern lock feature (discussed in detail below in part II). Some go so far as to say that most pattern locks can be breached in just 5 attempts or less. Imagine that!</p><p>What is more, research has found that humans have an uncanny ability to correctly guess a pattern lock simply by viewing the unlocking! The test comprised showing the test subjects videos of users unlocking their phones from different angles and varying distances, and it was found that around 64% of test subjects were able to correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock in one viewing only, and 80% could correctly guess the pattern after just two viewings. By contrast, only 11% were able to correctly deduce a 6-digit PIN after one viewing, and only 27% after viewing twice. This goes to show just how insecure pattern locks are!</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks"></a>Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks</h2><p>We might wonder how anyone would be able to guess the correct pattern of our device, but believe it or not, it is possible, eerily easily at that! We are all the same humans, after all! You know how people usually set PINs that could be significant dates in their lives? How they get car registration numbers that mean something to them? The same ‘logic’ applies to their setting pattern locks.</p><p>At DEFCON 23, Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, presented something that stunned people around the world. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.” What followed was an expert presentation outlining and detailing user behaviors around pattern locks.</p><p>These are some commonly created pattern locks by people:</p><ul><li>- shapes of alphabets,</li><li>- shapes of numerals,</li><li>- any other easy-to-make, simple shape.</li></ul><p>Marte Loge presented the image below, showing how people naturally gravitate towards creating simple shape patterns, in her research.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-2.jpg"                      alt="common pattern locks"                ></p><p>To further help you see how easy it might be for anyone to guess your pattern, Marte Loge also presented some statistics.</p><ul><li>- 77% of people started their patterns in one of the 4 corners.</li><li>- 44% of Loge’s subjects started their pattern with the first dot, the top-left one. The next number was 15% for the top-right and 14% for the bottom-left.</li><li>- These percentages did not vary much depending on left-handedness or right-handedness.</li><li>- On average, irrespective of gender, people set 5-point patterns, with 4-point patterns being the most common.

You can perform this method if you have your Google account credentials and are ready. However, we want you to back up your data so you can sign once more after the reset and restore a ton of your data.</p><p>Since you’re locked out, you will have to utilize a technique to do the reset.

So, if the Find my Device option feature is enabled on your phone, you can tap the <strong>Erase device</strong> choice on this page to reset it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/what-is-my-phone-password-3.jpg"                      alt="google find my device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Enter-Recovery-Mode-to-Hard-Reset"><a href="#2-Enter-Recovery-Mode-to-Hard-Reset" class="headerlink" title="2. Enter Recovery Mode to Hard Reset"></a>2. Enter Recovery Mode to Hard Reset</h3><p>If you can’t use the Find my device feature, you’ll have to factory reset physically.

If you haven’t set up a screen lock pattern on your device, then we recommend you to do the same right away. Not only will it keep intruders away, it will also protect your privacy. To learn how to set up a lock screen pattern on an Android device, simply follow these steps:</p><ul><li>1. Firstly, unlock your device and go to its Settings. You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.</li><li>2. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.</li><li>3. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378431872.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-unlock your device"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378838236.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-Under the personal or privacy section"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379016188.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-access Lock Screen and Security"                ></p><ul><li>4. To set up a pattern lock screen, tap on the “Screen lock type” feature.</li><li>5. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none. In “Swipe”, you can unlock a device just by swiping the screen. Whereas, in pattern, pin, or password, you would be needed to provide the respective pattern&#x2F;pin&#x2F;password to unlock the Honor 100 Pro device.</li><li>6. We recommend setting up a lock screen pattern instead. To do this, tap on the “Pattern” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379466607.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-tap on the “Screen lock type” feature"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/15057379692063.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen- provide the respective pattern"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379835226.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-tap on the “Pattern” option"                ></p><ul><li>7. From the next screen, you can simply draw any kind of pattern of your choice. Ideally, it should join at least 4 dots on the screen. We recommend using a strong screen lock pattern to provide unmatched security to your device.</li><li>8. Furthermore, you need to confirm your choice and provide the same pattern once again. Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.</li><li>9. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well. In case if you will forget your pattern, then you can access your phone by taking the assistance of this pin.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380143598.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380317550.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-provide the same pattern"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380506350.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-provide a security pin"                ></p><ul><li>10. Similarly, you would be required to confirm the pin as well to finish the setup.</li><li>11. That’s it! By completing these steps, a screen lock pattern will be implemented on your device.</li></ul><p>Later, you can follow the same drill to change your device’s lock screen pattern as well. Though, you would be needed to provide the existing pattern to access these features. Out of all the lock screen options, you should go with the pattern lock. Not only it is the most accessible option, it also provides fast results with an added security.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-to-do-if-you-forget-Android-pattern-lock"><a href="#Part-2-What-to-do-if-you-forget-Android-pattern-lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What to do if you forget Android pattern lock?"></a>Part 2: What to do if you forget Android pattern lock?</h2><p>After following the above-mentioned tutorial, you would be able to set up a pattern lock screen on your device.
