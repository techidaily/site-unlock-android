Securing them with a PIN, passcode, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock has become the norm. It’s like putting a digital lock on our private world.</p><p>But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.</p><p>That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg"                      alt="android emergency call screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?</h2><p>The <strong>Android emergency call bypass</strong> method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html"><u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u></a>. It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.</p><p><strong>“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls</strong> be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html"><u>reset your password </u></a> through official channels.</p><h3 id="Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method"></a>Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method</h3><p>However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.</p><p>But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the <strong>emergency call bypass</strong> can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="android emergency screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen"></a>Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen</h2><p>Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important. Remember, this method exploits a security flaw and should be used as a last resort.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen"></a>Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen</h2><p>While the <strong>emergency call bypass for Android</strong> method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions. Modern devices have significantly improved security, making this method obsolete. There are other, more reliable methods for those needing to unlock their phone’s screen.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Wondershare-Dr-Fone-–-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#Method-1-Wondershare-Dr-Fone-–-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Wondershare Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock"></a>Method 1: Wondershare Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock</h3><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> is a comprehensive software solution for various mobile issues, including screen unlocking.

Securing them with a PIN, passcode, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock has become the norm. It’s like putting a digital lock on our private world.</p><p>But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.</p><p>That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg"                      alt="android emergency call screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?</h2><p>The <strong>Android emergency call bypass</strong> method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html"><u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u></a>. It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.</p><p><strong>“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls</strong> be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html"><u>reset your password </u></a> through official channels.</p><h3 id="Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method"></a>Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method</h3><p>However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.</p><p>But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the <strong>emergency call bypass</strong> can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="android emergency screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen"></a>Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen</h2><p>Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important. Remember, this method exploits a security flaw and should be used as a last resort.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen"></a>Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen</h2><p>While the <strong>emergency call bypass for Android</strong> method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions. Modern devices have significantly improved security, making this method obsolete.

It has the basic functions of course but it really is only fan when others you know, use the same app as well. This fact kind of restricts this otherwise excellent application but the idea is genius. An Android unlock screen app that allows your creative side to shine through.</p><p>This Android unlock app doesn’t allow pin lock screen at the moment, it can be unlocked with the home button</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/05/14631658028688.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-Lok Lok"                ></p><h2 id="3-Next-News-Lock-Screen"><a href="#3-Next-News-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="3.Next News Lock Screen"></a>3.Next News Lock Screen</h2><p>When you are looking for unlock apps for android, you don’t necessarily think about reading the news, yet many times you would go to lengths to find them. What if the news you find the most interesting would appear on your lock screen? Would that be something you’d interested be in? If the answer is yes, this Android unlock screen app is for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/05/14631658526635.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-Next News Lock Screen"                ></p><h2 id="4-CM-Locker"><a href="#4-CM-Locker" class="headerlink" title="4.CM Locker"></a>4.CM Locker</h2><p>A very interesting application with a slide-to-unlock feature that’s eerily similar to iPhone devices. The app allows you to control several main phone functions including but not limited to brightness, WiFi, sound or Bluetooth. One of the most versatile unlock apps for Android.</p><p>This android unlock app allows pin and pattern unlock, and it also has an intruder alert (the phone locks and takes a photo when somebody unsuccessfully tries to unlock it).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/05/14631659122551.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-CM Locker"                ></p><h2 id="5-Slidelock-Locker"><a href="#5-Slidelock-Locker" class="headerlink" title="5.Slidelock Locker"></a>5.Slidelock Locker</h2><p>Another app that takes advantage of Apple’s popularity by bringing in the “slide-to-unlock” mechanics and the general aesthetic qualities of the iOS home screen. In addition to possessing the basic functions, this Android unlock screen app also highlights messages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/05/14631659338843.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-Slidelock Locker"                ></p><h2 id="6-Semper"><a href="#6-Semper" class="headerlink" title="6.Semper"></a>6.Semper</h2><p>This Android unlock app was once called UnlockYourBrain and it is quite unique in the way that it will make you work for your phone time. This may sound ridiculous at first, but actually a very clever idea and naturally emergency numbers can be called at all times.</p><p>Google Play link: <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.unlockyourbrain&hl=en" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.unlockyourbrain&hl=en <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>How to unlock : Solve a problem or an equation to unlock the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/05/14631659402691.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-semper"                ></p><h2 id="7-Next-Lock-Screen"><a href="#7-Next-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="7.Next Lock Screen"></a>7.Next Lock Screen</h2><p>Next Lock Screen is a cross platform unlock app that’s compatible with the complete Android ecosystem, making it one of the most valuable unlock apps for Android on the market. As a Microsoft product, it likes to advertise some of their other applications but this feature can thankfully be turned off. The notifications are clearly Microsoft quality which is not necessarily something that can be said about your average Android unlock screen app.</p><p>How to unlock : Pin,swipe or pattern.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/next-lock-screen.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-Next Lock Screen"                ></p><h2 id="8-AcDisplay"><a href="#8-AcDisplay" class="headerlink" title="8.AcDisplay"></a>8.AcDisplay</h2><p>AcDisplay comes with a rather minimalistic look similar to some of the most popular web site creator services like Squarespace or Wix. The home screen will highlight notifications for which it will offer two options, either you swipe down in which case you will ignore the notification, or swipe anywhere else and the lock screen will unlock. What’s really great about this Android unlock app is the fact that it can use your device’s sensors, allowing it to detect its placement therefore whether or not it should be on or off.</p><p>Google Play link: <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.achep.acdisplay&hl=en" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.achep.acdisplay&hl=en <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>How to unlock : You can swipe anywhere on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/05/14631660873877.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-AcDisplay"                ></p><h2 id="9-C-Locker-Pro"><a href="#9-C-Locker-Pro" class="headerlink" title="9.C Locker Pro"></a>9.C Locker Pro</h2><p>It would be unjust to call it an Android unlock app, this application is actually a carefully selected package that allows you to do a lot of cools stuff with your new and improved home screen. Not only it supports the usually methods of unlocking like swipe or patterns, but you can actually set double or even triple tap options which is quite unique and a very good idea. The app has every other usual options including setting your favorite apps or showing the lock, as well as the date and the temperature of course.</p><p>Google Play link: <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccs.lockscreen_pro&hl=en" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccs.lockscreen_pro&amp;hl&#x3D;en <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>How to unlock : This Android unlock screen app allows you to unlock the screen with swiping, patterns or even specific number of taps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/c-locker-pro.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-C Locker Pro"                ></p><h2 id="10-Echo-Notificaiton-Lockscreen"><a href="#10-Echo-Notificaiton-Lockscreen" class="headerlink" title="10.

Echo Notificaiton Lockscreen</h2><p>Another minimalistic design that works quite well, it also allows you to set different notification categories like “work”, “media” or “social”. Not only that, but you can also choose various apps to go with those categories. Messages come through as well of course, all with a “slide to unlock” feature that is so popular these days.</p><p>How to unlock : Slide right like you would with an iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/echo-notificaiton-lockscreen.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-Echo Notificaiton Lockscreen"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus Tips:</strong> Easily bypass Android Lock Screen&#x2F;Google FRP on Android with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

But you can try to reset your Google account first.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)"></a>Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)</h2><p>Even if you have a Google account, if your phone isn’t connected to the internet, you cannot access it to unlock your phone. If this sounds familiar, you can always try this method.</p><p>1. First, navigate to the Android Device Manager page. You will need to sign in with the Google account that you use to set up your phone.</p><p>Android Device Manager link: <a class="link"   href="http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager" >http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942446007.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager log in"                ></p><p>2. Once you have logged in, you will automatically be redirected to the Android Device Manager page. If this is your first time, click the “Accept” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942473262.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager start"                ></p><p>3. A list of all of the Tecno Spark 20C devices registered to this Android account will pop up. Select the Tecno Spark 20C device in question from this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942503282.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager list of devices"                ></p><p>4. The Android Device Manager will then locate your device. Make sure it is turned on!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942532352.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager locating device"                ></p><p>5. After it has been located, you will have a few options for what to do next. If you do not know your phone’s location, you can call it from this screen, but if you know where it is, click the ‘Enable Lock &amp; Erase’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942568385.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager device located"                ></p><p>6. A notification will pop up on your device; confirm it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942582896.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager Erase &amp; Lock"                ></p><p>7. At this point, you will be asked to create a new lock screen password. Once you have chosen one, press “Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637943377629.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager New Lock Screen"                ></p><p>8.

It will open, and you can get back to your daily routine.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone"></a>Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone</h2><p>If you have forgotten your Google Account password, it is still possible to unlock your account and access the information within. Here is how you can unlock your Google account on your Android phone.</p><p>1. On your browser, go to the Google home page and try to sign in. You will fail, but that is good! It will lead you to the next step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535742329.jpg"                      alt="android Google web page"                ></p><p>2. Since you cannot sign in on the sign-in page, you can now select the ‘Help’ link.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535763672.jpg"                      alt="android Goodle log in"                ></p><p>3. Choose the “forgot password” option. You will be prompted to enter your email address to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535788151.jpg"                      alt="android Google trouble signing in"                ></p><p>4. Two options will then appear: the first is your phone number, and the other asks you for your backup email.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535828239.jpg"                      alt="android Google forgot password"                ><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535857339.jpg"                      alt="android Google forgot pssword enter email"                ></p><p>5. Enter either one of these options, and you will receive a verification code via email, SMS, or a telephone call from an operator. If you have chosen to enter your backup email, at this point, you will receive detailed instructions on how to access the ‘reset password’ page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637561923476.jpg"                      alt="android Google automated call verification"                ><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637561995841.jpg"                      alt="android Google automated call verification"                ></p><p>6.

Finally, you can unlock your Google account on your Android! Confirm this by clicking the “Change Password” button.

To access the myriad of features these devices offer, Google provides several unlocking methods, ensuring both convenience and security. Here are these options:</p><ul><li>A Personal Identification Number (PIN) is a simple yet effective way to secure your phone. It’s a numeric code that you enter on the lock screen. Setting up a PIN is straightforward via the Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ device’s security settings, and unlocking your phone is as easy as tapping in the correct sequence of numbers.</li><li>Similar to a PIN but potentially more secure due to the allowance of a longer combination of numbers and letters. A passcode is ideal for those who seek an extra layer of security. You set it up in the security settings and use it to unlock your phone just like a PIN but with the added complexity of alphanumeric characters.</li><li><strong>Face Unlock.Pixel’s Face Unlock</strong> uses advanced facial recognition software.

It’s fast, secure, and convenient. The Pixel 6a, 6, and 7 fingerprint scanners are actually under the display. Register your fingerprint in the settings, then touch the sensor to gain access.</li><li><strong>Pattern</strong>. If you prefer a more visual method, the <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mi-pattern-lock.html"><u>pattern lock</u></a>lets you draw a specific shape or pattern on the screen to unlock your phone. It’s a fun and interactive way to secure your device. Create your pattern in the security settings, and unlock your phone by replicating it on the lock screen.</li></ul><p>In essence, each unlocking method offered by the Tecno Spark 20 Pro+  provides a blend of security and ease. Whichever unlocking method you prefer, Google ensures that accessing your phone is secure and convenient.

It is the most powerful method to unlock a broken Android device. It will however only work if you have enabled USB debugging on your android phone. If you haven’t, skip this method and see if method 2 or 3 might be of help.</p><p>ADB creates a bridge between the PC and your device which can then be used to unlock the Tecno Spark 20 device. Here’s how to use this bridge.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the Android SDK package on your PC. You can download it here: <a class="link"   href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" >http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Extract the ZIP file on your PC.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Download the necessary drivers for your device. The USB drivers for your device can be found on the manufacturer’s website.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Launch Command Prompt on your PC and change the location of the ADB file. Type in the following into Command Prompt; <em>cd C:&#x2F;android&#x2F;platform-tools</em></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Connect the Tecno Spark 20 device to your PC using USB cables. Enter the command “ ADB _device_” (without quotation marks). If your phone is recognized, you will see numbers in the Command Prompt message.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Type in the following two commands. You will need to type in the second one immediately after the first. Replace 1234 with your password.</p><p><em>ADB shell input text 1234</em><br><em>Shell input key event 66</em></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Your phone will now be unlocked and you can proceed to back up its contents.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/style/images/arrow_up.png"                      alt="arrow"                ></p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android-1"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android-1" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The Best Tool to Reset Phones Without Android Factory Reset Codes</p><ul><li>It enables your Android phones to get safe, simple, and trustful after reset.</li><li>It is still helpful even though you don’t know the OS version of your devices.</li><li>Everybody can handle it without any technical background.</li><li>Provide specific removal solutions to promise good success rate.</li></ul><p><strong>4,008,670</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Method-2-Using-a-USB-Mouse-and-the-On-the-Go-Adapter"><a href="#Method-2-Using-a-USB-Mouse-and-the-On-the-Go-Adapter" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using a USB Mouse and the On the Go Adapter"></a>Method 2: Using a USB Mouse and the On the Go Adapter</h2><p>This is a great solution if you don’t have USB debugging enabled on your device. You will need your device, an OTG adapter and a USB mouse. It involves connecting the Tecno Spark 20 device to the USB mouse using the OTG adapter. Check if your device can be connected to a USB mouse. You can find an OTG adapter online, they are relatively inexpensive and very useful.</p><p>Before we begin, it is a good idea to ensure your device is sufficiently charged because the Mouse may drain your battery.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect the Micro USB side of the OTG adapter to your device and then plug in the USB mouse to the adapter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531933625473.jpg"                      alt="connect broken screen android phone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As soon as the Tecno Spark 20 devices are connected, you will be able to see a pointer on your screen. You can then use the pointer to unlock the pattern or enter the Tecno Spark 20 device’s password lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531933791903.jpg"                      alt="unlock android with broken screen"                ></p><p>You can then go about backing up the contents of your device.</p><h2 id="Method-3-Using-your-Samsung-Account"><a href="#Method-3-Using-your-Samsung-Account" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using your Samsung Account"></a>Method 3: Using your Samsung Account</h2><p>This method is a reliable way to unlock a Samsung device that has a broken screen or is not working correctly. While it is highly effective you will need to have a Samsung account registered with your device. The problem is that not many Samsung device users have registered their devices with the service. If you are among the lucky few who have, here’s how to use your account to unlock your device.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the <a class="link"   href="https://findmymobile.samsung.com/login.do" >https://findmymobile.samsung.com/login.do <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your PC or any other device and log in with your account information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531933993021.jpg"                      alt="unlock android with broken screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select your device from the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You should see the option “Unlock my screen” on the sidebar. Click on it and you will get instructions on how to access your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531934188479.jpg"                      alt="unlock android using samsung account"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Being unable to unlock your device is never a good place to be. We hope one of the above solutions will work for you. You can then gain access to your device and back up the files and contacts. This way your life doesn’t have to be disrupted- you can just restore the backup on a new device or the old one once the screen is fixed.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-15-apps-to-hack-wifi-password-on-infinix-hot-40-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 15 Apps To Hack WiFi Password On Infinix Hot 40</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/10-easy-to-use-frp-bypass-tools-for-unlocking-google-accounts-on-infinix-note-30-pro-by-drfone-android/"><u>10 Easy-to-Use FRP Bypass Tools for Unlocking Google Accounts On Infinix Note 30 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/still-using-pattern-locks-with-itel-p40-tips-tricks-and-helpful-advice-by-drfone-android/"><u>Still Using Pattern Locks with Itel P40?

It’s fast, secure, and convenient. The Pixel 6a, 6, and 7 fingerprint scanners are actually under the display. Register your fingerprint in the settings, then touch the sensor to gain access.</li><li><strong>Pattern</strong>. If you prefer a more visual method, the <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mi-pattern-lock.html"><u>pattern lock</u></a>lets you draw a specific shape or pattern on the screen to unlock your phone.

And, of course, you should always note your passwords.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="android emergency screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen"></a>Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen</h2><p>Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important. Remember, this method exploits a security flaw and should be used as a last resort.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen"></a>Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen</h2><p>While the <strong>emergency call bypass for Android</strong> method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions.

This allows users to customize their devices extensively. However, despite this openness, certain features and capabilities can still be locked or restricted, either by Google or the Tecno Pova 5 device manufacturer.</p><p>For those looking to truly unleash the full potential of their Android device, an OEM unlock is an essential step. This article will delve into the process of <strong>OEM unlocking on Android</strong>, guiding you through its benefits and how to safely perform it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-01.jpg"                      alt="android phone with padlock"                ></p><p><strong>OEM lock</strong> might sound like technical jargon to many. However, it’s a key concept for those who wish to dive deeper into Android customization. OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer. Unlocking in this context refers to removing restrictions made by the manufacturer on the Tecno Pova 5 device.</p><p>This process allows you to gain deeper access to the Tecno Pova 5 device’s software.

It allows users to access and modify the Tecno Pova 5 device’s software at the deepest level.</p><p>This can enable the installation of apps and software that require more permissions than what is typically available. On the other hand, custom ROMs can change your device’s interface.

It does open the door to several customizations and tweaks. However, it can also compromise the security of your device. There’s always a chance of bricking your phone, especially if the unlocking process isn’t followed correctly or an unstable custom ROM is installed.</p><p>Additionally, most manufacturers will void your warranty once you unlock the bootloader.

It allows you to gain superuser access, enabling modifications and access to system files that were previously restricted. With rooting, you can:</p><ul><li>Remove pre-installed apps or bloatware.</li><li>Customize system settings and UI elements.</li><li>Enhance performance or battery life through underclocking or overclocking the CPU.</li></ul><h3 id="Flash-a-Custom-ROM"><a href="#Flash-a-Custom-ROM" class="headerlink" title="Flash a Custom ROM"></a>Flash a Custom ROM</h3><p>A custom ROM is a new operating system you can install on your device.

The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G phones refusing to work with different carriers.</p><p>The issue limits the smartphone’s functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for <strong>Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G network unlock</strong> solutions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-unlock-a-network-locked-oneplus-phone-01.jpg"                      alt="unlock a network locked Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G phone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-When-Your-Tecno-Camon-30-Pro-5G-Phone-is-Network-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-When-Your-Tecno-Camon-30-Pro-5G-Phone-is-Network-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G Phone is Network Locked?"></a>Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G Phone is Network Locked?</h2><p>In the simplest words, a network-locked Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased. Another problem is that there is no automatic unlocking even after the expiry of your contract with the carrier service. Having a network-locked Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G phone poses undesired connectivity issues.</p><h3 id="1-Why-is-my-phone-locked-to-the-network-carrier"><a href="#1-Why-is-my-phone-locked-to-the-network-carrier" class="headerlink" title="1. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?"></a>1. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?</h3><p>Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier. Reasons for switching can be the availability of better plans, discounts, etc. Another cause of locking the phones to specific carriers is preventing them from theft and unauthorized usage.</p><h3 id="2-Is-it-legal-to-unlock-it"><a href="#2-Is-it-legal-to-unlock-it" class="headerlink" title="2. Is it legal to unlock it?"></a>2. Is it legal to unlock it?</h3><p>Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Unlock-a-Network-Locked-Tecno-Camon-30-Pro-5G-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Unlock-a-Network-Locked-Tecno-Camon-30-Pro-5G-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Here’s what you should do:</p><ol><li><strong>Contact Your Network Provider</strong></li></ol><p>Contact your network provider to receive the network unlock code if you are the actual buyer of the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G device.

Setting up a PIN is straightforward via the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G device’s security settings, and unlocking your phone is as easy as tapping in the correct sequence of numbers.</li><li>Similar to a PIN but potentially more secure due to the allowance of a longer combination of numbers and letters. A passcode is ideal for those who seek an extra layer of security. You set it up in the security settings and use it to unlock your phone just like a PIN but with the added complexity of alphanumeric characters.</li><li><strong>Face Unlock.Pixel’s Face Unlock</strong> uses advanced facial recognition software. It scans your face to grant access, offering a hands-free and quick way to unlock your Pixel. This feature can be activated in the security settings and requires a simple glance at your phone to unlock.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/google-pixel-7-unlock-02.jpg"                      alt="woman holding a Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G  "                ></p><ul><li><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/google-pixel-frp-bypass.html"><strong><u><b>Fingerprint Unlock</b></u></strong></a><strong>.</strong> This method uses your unique fingerprint as a key. It’s fast, secure, and convenient. The Pixel 6a, 6, and 7 fingerprint scanners are actually under the display. Register your fingerprint in the settings, then touch the sensor to gain access.</li><li><strong>Pattern</strong>. If you prefer a more visual method, the <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mi-pattern-lock.html"><u>pattern lock</u></a>lets you draw a specific shape or pattern on the screen to unlock your phone. It’s a fun and interactive way to secure your device. Create your pattern in the security settings, and unlock your phone by replicating it on the lock screen.</li></ul><p>In essence, each unlocking method offered by the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G  provides a blend of security and ease. Whichever unlocking method you prefer, Google ensures that accessing your phone is secure and convenient. All you need to do is set up your preferred method in the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G device’s settings and use it to unlock your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-To-Do-if-You-Forgot-Your-Screen-Unlock-Method"><a href="#Part-2-What-To-Do-if-You-Forgot-Your-Screen-Unlock-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What To Do if You Forgot Your Screen Unlock Method"></a>Part 2: What To Do if You Forgot Your Screen Unlock Method</h2><p>Forgetting the screen unlock method on your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G , whether it’s a PIN, passcode, pattern, or encountering face or fingerprint recognition issues, can be a frustrating experience.
