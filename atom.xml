Enabling the ADM is quite easy; just go to google.com&#x2F;android&#x2F;devicemanager  on your computer and search through your list of devices that are already connected to your Google account. Once you are there, you can easily send a notification to the phone you want to enable remote password application and wiping upon.</p><p>ADM comes with a set of features that helps you to unlock your Android phone as well. It not only helps you to find your device, but also Ring it, lock it, and wipe and erase all the data as well, if your phone is lost or stolen. Once you’re logged into the ADM website from your computer, you can avail all these options once your phone is located. It is a wise option to get your device locked by Android Device Manager in case it is lost or stolen, so that your phone is secured.</p><p>Android Device Manager can unlock your phone under a specific set of circumstances only.</p><ul><li>• First of all, Android Device Manager needs to be enabled on your phone before it is lost, stolen, etc.</li><li>• Secondly, your phone can only be tracked by ADM if the GPS option is switched on.</li><li>• Thirdly, the Honor Magic 5 Pro device you are using for ADM, must be connected to Wi-Fi or internet, to login to your Google account.</li><li>• Lastly, Android Device Manager is not compatible for all Android versions. For now, it is only compatible with devices running Android 4.4 and above, so your phone must be in this category for ADM to work.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-Android-phone-with-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-Android-phone-with-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock Android phone with Android Device Manager?"></a>Part 2: How to unlock Android phone with Android Device Manager?</h2><p>Just act according to the following steps, and the Android Device Manager will unlock your phone.</p><p>1. On your computer or any other mobile phone, visit: google.com&#x2F;android&#x2F;devicemanager</p><p>2. Then, sign in with the help of your Google login details that you had used in your locked phone as well.</p><p>3. In the ADM interface, choose the Honor Magic 5 Pro device you want to unlock. Now, select “Lock”.</p><p>4. Enter a temporary password. Now go ahead and click on “Lock” again.</p><p>5. If the previous step was successful, you should be seeing a confirmation below the box with the buttons – Ring, Lock and Erase.</p><p>6. Now, you should see a password field on your phone screen.

Many users have reported the issue, that when they have tried using ADM to unlock their locked device, an error message has occurred, saying, “since Google has verified that a screen lock is already set”. Basically, this error message conveys that you will not be able to unlock your phone using Android Device Manager, and this is a flaw on Google’s part, not your phone’s.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-to-do-if-phone-is-locked-by-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#Part-3-What-to-do-if-phone-is-locked-by-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What to do if phone is locked by Android Device Manager"></a>Part 3: What to do if phone is locked by Android Device Manager</h2><p>There are 2 situations where you would want to know how to unlock the Android Device Manager lock – one, when you have unfortunately forgotten the screen lock passcode and the other is when your phone is locked by Android Device Manager.</p><p>ADM is built to completely lock your device so that unknown people cannot access it. So, if your phone is locked by Android Device Manager, you might be in a problem.While ADM is a wonderful tool to lock your phone or erase and wipe data if its stolen or lost, most of the users have reported the issue that they cannot unlock their phones that are locked by Android Device Manager. A possible solution to this is adding a temporary password via Google login and bypassing the ADM lock. Or, you can try resetting the password again by entering a new password via ADM.

To reach the lock screen settings android, you’ve to follow the path:</p><p>Options – Security – Screen Lock – Choose Screen Lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-1.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Now see how to unlock your lock screen in different ways.</p><h3 id="1-Slide"><a href="#1-Slide" class="headerlink" title="1.Slide"></a>1.Slide</h3><p>This is the most common method of unlocking an android lock screen. On all most all the android device, you’ll notice a lock mostly on the right side (sometimes on top) of a round charm. You just have to direct towards the lock and then the lock screen will be unlocked in no time. This method doesn’t provide any security (it just protects your device from sudden access by tapping on screen or any of the button) to your device as no password or PIN is required to set the “Slide” unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-3.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Keep your any finger on the middle of the round charm and by keeping your finger pressed, reach on the lock icon.

After you set the snapped photo as the unlocking recognition, you could unlock your device through showing your face on the screen.</p><p>Capture a picture of your face with your Android device’s camera and then set it for logging in into your device. From the lock screen, by just by holding your face, you can log in. It’s very interesting, but you should never rely on this method for strong security as this method of unlocking is prone to break easily as an intruder can unlock your device by putting a photo of you in front of your device. Moreover, this method sometimes doesn’t work properly. So it’s better to go for some other highly secured options for locking your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-4.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="3-Pattern"><a href="#3-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="3.Pattern"></a>3.Pattern</h3><p>This is a way of setting pattern for lock screen from a grid of nine dots. You can select the pattern like some letter like Z, L or C etc, but nothing guarantees high security as the set pattern can be easily guessed or be seen while you are unlocking your device. Another problem is that by unlocking with the same pattern, your finger leaves some marks for the pattern’s path. By following the path, a stranger can unlock your device. So for little security, you can use pattern unlock method on your Android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-5.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for Pattern and then set the pattern by sliding your finger from one dot to another, then another and like that way. Remember which pattern you’ve set in order to unlock your device in the next time.</p><h3 id="4-PIN"><a href="#4-PIN" class="headerlink" title="4.PIN"></a>4.PIN</h3><p>You might be troubled by thinking about the difference between PIN and Password. A little distinction is there for a PIN and that is it consists of numbers only whereas for password, you can associate some alphabetical letters or signs along with numbers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-6.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for PIN and then set a PIN that consists of minimum 4 digits. It’s your choice to use 4 or more digit PIN. After setting the PIN, you can access your Android device by putting the PIN in a box from the lock screen. PIN protected lock screen is highly protected if the PIN is set strongly.</p><h3 id="5-Password"><a href="#5-Password" class="headerlink" title="5.Password"></a>5.Password</h3><p>In addition to PIN protection, you can consider it as password by adding some letters, special characters with the previously selected PIN codes. It’s also very much highly protected method of locking screen though you might be bored with tapping for the password again and again. But never ignore the value of your device’s files, so a password can be a well-sought lock screen protection for many users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-7.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="6-Fingerprint"><a href="#6-Fingerprint" class="headerlink" title="6.Fingerprint"></a>6.Fingerprint</h3><p>In some of the modern Android device, you’ll find the feature of fingerprint unlocking. You can find the option through the screen or any dedicated button. By setting your fingerprint, you can unlock your device by tapping your finger on the Honor Magic 5 Lite device’s screen or the dedicated button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-8.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="7-Voice"><a href="#7-Voice" class="headerlink" title="7.Voice"></a>7.Voice</h3><p>This is also a fun way of unlocking Android lock screen as you can unlock by saying the same voice that you’ve saved as the unlocking recognition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-9.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the setting from “Voice Unlock” button and record your voice such as “Open My Honor Magic 5 Lite” or as per your choice with clear sound.

If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.</p><h3 id="2-Hard-Reset-your-phone"><a href="#2-Hard-Reset-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="2. Hard Reset your phone"></a>2. Hard Reset your phone</h3><p>To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-2.jpg"                      alt="android hard reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Turn off your phone and hold the Power and Volume-down buttons simultaneously until the recovery mode screen appears. There are minor variations depending on the brand and model.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the Wipe data&#x2F;Factory Reset option using the volume buttons. To confirm the option, press the Power button.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Choose Yes &gt; Delete All User Data, then press the power button to continue. When the process is complete, turn on your phone.</p><p>So, before facing such awkward cases, like data loss, we suggest you have a backup habit of keeping your data safe.</p><h3 id="3-Google-Find-My-Device"><a href="#3-Google-Find-My-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Google Find My Device"></a>3. Google Find My Device</h3><p>Google Find My Device is a service that lets you remotely lock, track, and wipe data from stolen or lost phones. With a Google account and the password, it won’t be complicated to remove any locks on your phone. You can bypass the Android lock screen by following the steps below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-3.jpg"                      alt="google find my device data reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to Find My Device and sign in with your Google account.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Your phone receives a notification.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select Erase Device, confirm, and click Erase as a warning pops up on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The factory reset process on your phone begins. When it’s finished, choose My Google Account instead of using your phone as if it were brand new.</p><p>Just like the hard reset, after using Google Find My Device, all your data and settings will be erased. Please make everything well prepared before you decide to unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock"><a href="#Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock" class="headerlink" title="Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock"></a>Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock</h2><p>The methods mentioned above may be hard for you, and you don’t know any technical skills.

Tips, Tricks and Helpful Advice</h2><p>They have been along for a long, long time now – pattern locks – the easiest of all smartphone locks. You just swipe your finger across to create an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> of your choosing and that’s it, it becomes your new screen lock. No more remembering tedious digits! So, why have these easy pattern locks become outdated, and why do people still continue to use them? Let’s take a dive and find out all about pattern locks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="creating more secure pattern locks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-Things-To-Know-About-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-I-Things-To-Know-About-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks"></a>Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks</h2><p>The first cellphone locks were 4-digit number locks. Then came 6-digit codes, and even alphanumeric ones. Pattern locks were all the rage a while ago. Though pattern locks continue to be used, they are not considered safe to use any longer. What is all that about? Here’s what you need to know about pattern locks, whether you are a seasoned pattern lock user or not.</p><h3 id="I-I-What-Are-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#I-I-What-Are-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?"></a>I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?</h3><p>Believe it or not, technology has advanced at such a rapid pace in the last two decades that you’d be forgiven if you don’t know what a pattern lock is, especially if you have only ever used iPhones, or Android phones in just the last few years.</p><p>Pattern locks are patterns you create on your smartphone and designate as a smartphone lock&#x2F; screen lock. There is a 9-point keypad of sorts, and you start swiping your finger from any point to any point for any which way you feel like. Android 13 allows a minimum of 4 points registered. They are easy to create, and easy to use, hence called easy pattern locks.</p><p>Pattern locks have only ever been offered on Android devices and were commonplace a few years ago until they were deemed not secure enough for use by modern standards because they were <em>easy</em> to figure out by malicious actors.</p><h3 id="I-II-Popularity-and-Usage"><a href="#I-II-Popularity-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="I.II: Popularity and Usage"></a>I.II: Popularity and Usage</h3><p>Pattern lock is a feature unique to Android and has been so since the start. Naturally, it is one of the preferred ways users have come to unlock their Android devices over the years. Even though modern Android smartphones come with fingerprint recognition and face recognition technologies, there exists a large subset of users still addicted to and acclimatized with the pattern lock feature, opting over fingerprint and face recognition.</p><p>There has been, however, research conducted into the safety and security offered by pattern lock in Android.</p><h3 id="I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>Modern smartphones very nearly contain the entirety of our lives; photo memories, video memories, important documents both financial and personal in nature, banking apps, ID and ATM&#x2F; credit cards in the “wallet” apps, and whatnot. A smartphone falling into the wrong hands could very nearly be used to devastate the rightful owner, both financially and otherwise. And this is not a claim out of thin air; spyware&#x2F; malware&#x2F; phishing attacks are on the rise around the world. Locking the smartphone, once considered optional and an unnecessary hassle, is now an absolute must.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There is no denying that using an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> to lock their smartphone seems enough for most users. Swiping your finger across your smartphone to unlock it feels not only cool and futuristic but safer and more secure than remembering and punching in digits. And, for the most part, it is true, given that 4-digit PINs can only have 10,000 unique combinations!</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>While very easy to use, security researchers and experts have come to agree that the feature is not in the least safe to use, and that is because of how people use the pattern lock feature (discussed in detail below in part II). Some go so far as to say that most pattern locks can be breached in just 5 attempts or less. Imagine that!</p><p>What is more, research has found that humans have an uncanny ability to correctly guess a pattern lock simply by viewing the unlocking! The test comprised showing the test subjects videos of users unlocking their phones from different angles and varying distances, and it was found that around 64% of test subjects were able to correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock in one viewing only, and 80% could correctly guess the pattern after just two viewings. By contrast, only 11% were able to correctly deduce a 6-digit PIN after one viewing, and only 27% after viewing twice. This goes to show just how insecure pattern locks are!</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks"></a>Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks</h2><p>We might wonder how anyone would be able to guess the correct pattern of our device, but believe it or not, it is possible, eerily easily at that! We are all the same humans, after all! You know how people usually set PINs that could be significant dates in their lives? How they get car registration numbers that mean something to them? The same ‘logic’ applies to their setting pattern locks.</p><p>At DEFCON 23, Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, presented something that stunned people around the world. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.” What followed was an expert presentation outlining and detailing user behaviors around pattern locks.</p><p>These are some commonly created pattern locks by people:</p><ul><li>- shapes of alphabets,</li><li>- shapes of numerals,</li><li>- any other easy-to-make, simple shape.</li></ul><p>Marte Loge presented the image below, showing how people naturally gravitate towards creating simple shape patterns, in her research.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-2.jpg"                      alt="common pattern locks"                ></p><p>To further help you see how easy it might be for anyone to guess your pattern, Marte Loge also presented some statistics.</p><ul><li>- 77% of people started their patterns in one of the 4 corners.</li><li>- 44% of Loge’s subjects started their pattern with the first dot, the top-left one. The next number was 15% for the top-right and 14% for the bottom-left.</li><li>- These percentages did not vary much depending on left-handedness or right-handedness.</li><li>- On average, irrespective of gender, people set 5-point patterns, with 4-point patterns being the most common. This means that the number of combinations on average was 7152 for 5-point patterns and a bogglingly low 1624 for 4-point patterns.</li></ul><p>The above data makes it amply clear how using an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> is actually worse than using a 4-digit PIN, simply because how people are usually using the pattern lock feature.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Tips-For-Using-More-Secure-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-III-Tips-For-Using-More-Secure-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks"></a>Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks</h2><p>Now, we know how hard it is to break habits cemented over years of use, so in case you must at all costs use a pattern lock only, the least you can do is try and change your easy pattern lock to a better, more secure hard pattern lock.</p><h4 id="III-I-How-to-Create-More-Secure-Patterns"><a href="#III-I-How-to-Create-More-Secure-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns"></a>III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns</h4><p>Here are some tips to help you create a better, more secure pattern lock for your smartphone.</p><ul><li>- Avoid using any of the corners to start the pattern.</li><li>- Never use your first initial as a pattern.</li><li>- Never use a digit shape as a pattern.</li><li>- You can pass through the same pattern lines multiple times over. This makes it more difficult for someone to guess your pattern correctly.</li><li>- Use all 9 points on the grid while setting the pattern lock! That simple act takes the possible pattern combinations to over 140,000, significantly more than 10,000 for 4-digit PINs, and vastly superior to paltry 1624 for a 4-point <strong>easy pattern lock</strong>!</li></ul><h4 id="III-II-Forgot-Your-Pattern-Unlock-Your-Honor-90-Lite-Without-Pattern-Lock-With-Dr-Fone"><a href="#III-II-Forgot-Your-Pattern-Unlock-Your-Honor-90-Lite-Without-Pattern-Lock-With-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="III.II: Forgot Your Pattern?

As such, our recommendation is to start using a 6-digit PIN along with biometric or face recognition. However, we do understand that sometimes, you simply cannot use biometrics or face recognition. For those instances, we recommend that you use this guide and create a more secure pattern lock for your device.

Common Problems When Using Google Assistant"></a>Part 3. Common Problems When Using Google Assistant</h2><p>Unable to use <strong>Google Assistant to unlock phone</strong> is not the only drawback that users may have encountered in recent changes. Although Google Assistant on the lock screen presents a revolutionary way to interact with your phone, like any technology, it also comes with its share of challenges. Some of the common problems when using Google Assistant are:</p><ol><li><strong>Misunderstandings and misinterpretations</strong></li></ol><p>One prevalent issue users encounter is Google Assistant misunderstanding or misinterpreting voice commands. This can be influenced by factors such as background noise, accent variations, or pronunciation differences.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Limited context understanding</strong></li></ol><p>While Google Assistant is adept at understanding individual commands, it may struggle with complex, multi-step requests that rely heavily on context. Break down your tasks into simpler commands to enhance comprehension and execute it more accurately.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Inability to execute certain tasks</strong></li></ol><p>Google Assistant’s capabilities are extensive, but there are instances where it may struggle to execute specific tasks. For example, it can’t execute tasks that involve interacting with certain third-party applications or services. You can’t also <strong>unlock phone with voice Google Assistant.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-phone-with-voice-google-assistant-4.jpg"                      alt="Giving command to Google Asisstant on lock screen"                ></p><h3 id="Tips-to-Make-Voice-Google-Assistant-Recognize-Your-Commands"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-Voice-Google-Assistant-Recognize-Your-Commands" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make Voice Google Assistant Recognize Your Commands"></a>Tips to Make Voice Google Assistant Recognize Your Commands</h3><p>One of the most infuriating problems with voice Google Assistant is that users often encounter difficulties in having their commands accurately recognized. To enhance the accuracy of voice recognition with Google Assistant, you can consider implementing the following tips:</p><ol><li><strong>Speak Clearly and Naturally</strong></li></ol><p>Make sure that you speak in a clear and natural manner. Avoid mumbling or speaking too quickly. Enunciate your words, giving Google Assistant a better chance to interpret your commands accurately.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Use Simple and Direct Phrases</strong></li></ol><p>Keep your commands simple and direct. Avoid unnecessary elaboration or complex sentence structures. Google Assistant is more likely to understand straightforward commands.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Check Your Microphone</strong></li></ol><p>Ensure that your device’s microphone is in good working condition. Dirt or debris on your phone’s microphone can affect its performance. Clean the microphone area and try again.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Quiet Environment</strong></li></ol><p>Background noise can interfere with voice recognition. Try to issue commands in a quiet environment to minimize any potential confusion caused by external sounds.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Unlock-Android-Phone-Screen-Without-Passcode"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Unlock-Android-Phone-Screen-Without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Android seems to be controlling a considerably high portion of our life. We have bought many gadgets that use this amazing OS and most of which are phones. But how much can you do with your Android phone? Developers are always making it more interesting to use this interface.</p><p>Most of the time, we use Android phones, we get faced with the need to access the internet. The Wi-Fi capability of these Android gadgets makes it super easy for us to surf the web. Throughout using Wi-Fi, we connect to a number of them. This could be at school, a sub-way café, the gym, buses, hospitals, hotels, towns, and the list is endless. A password secures most of this. Needless to say, our brain is weak to store all these passwords for future use, especially if you would want to connect with a different gadget you have recently bought or even your laptop. In this article, we will introduce you to how to find wifi password on rooted and also unrooted Android devices.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/78mNMIr_wpI"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Rooted-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Rooted-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device"></a>Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device</h2><h3 id="What-is-Rooting"><a href="#What-is-Rooting" class="headerlink" title="What is Rooting?"></a>What is Rooting?</h3><p>First of all, what does rooting mean? You have probably used a Windows computer or even Linux. For the case of Windows, when installing a new program or software, it always prompts a dialog box saying, “Administrator permission required to run this program.” If you don’t have the administrator permission, you won’t install the program. In Android, this is called rooting. In simple terms, it means having the root permission to your phone. Some Android apps will require you the root permission, e.g., flashing your ROM. In this part, we will explain how you can show the Wi-Fi password on your Android with root.</p><p>To find the Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone, you need to have an app to explore files which also supports a root user. In this case, ES FileExplorer or Root Explorer will come in handy. However, it turns out that the latter is offered at $3. Let’s use the free ES File Explorer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556285763404.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><h3 id="Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root"><a href="#Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root" class="headerlink" title="Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root"></a>Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root</h3><p>In only four steps, we, at this moment, learn how we can find the password of a Wi-Fi on an Android phone.</p><p>Step 1: Install the ES File Explorer</p><p>Download the ES File Explorer from your play store, install it, and open it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556286507084.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 2: Enable Root Explorer</p><p>The root explorer needs to be enabled so that you can reach the root folders of the Wi-Fi passwords you need. By default, the root feature in this ES explorer is not enabled. To enable it, just tap on the list menu on the top left corner.:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556292611536.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>This will drop down a list of controls.

Scroll down and find “About phone.” Tap on it and scroll down again to find Build number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556302638925.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Tap on this “build number” 5 to 6 times until a message pops up, saying, “You are now a developer”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556303263992.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 2: Enable the debugging.</p><p>Go back to Settings. Scroll down for developer options. Turn on the button for “Android&#x2F;USB debugging”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556308665697.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 3: Install ADB drivers.</p><p>Now, open your Windows desktop. Download and install ADB drivers. (Use this download link <a class="link"   href="http://adbdriver.com/" >adbdriver.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). You need to download and install platform tools (minimal ADB and fastboot) from <a class="link"   href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2317790" >http://forum.xda-developers.com/... <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Now open the folder where you’ve installed the above tools. By default, it is in the Local disc <em>C\windows\system32\platform_tools</em> location. However, you might want to locate them by searching on the windows search engine. You have to hold the Shift key and right-click inside the folder to click on”Open Command Window Here.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329561742.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 4: Test the ADB</p><p>Here, we would like to test whether the ABD is working properly. To do this, connect your phone to the PC using a USB. In the command prompt, type <strong>adb services</strong> and then press enter. If it’s working properly, you should see a device on this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329984622.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 5: Find the Android wifi password.</p><p>Now, it is time to type the given command in the command prompt and type: <em>adb pull &#x2F;data&#x2F;misc&#x2F;wifi&#x2F;wpa_supplicant.conf c:&#x2F;wpa_supplicant.conf</em>. This will fetch the file from your phone to the local disc C drive of the PC.</p><p>Step 6: Get the wifi passwords.</p><p>Lastly, open the file with a notepad, and there you go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556331232772.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Now you learned how to show the wifi password on your Android device.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

It allows you to unlock your phone bootloader. A bootloader or bootstrap loader gathers the operating system files, loads them into memory, and hands over control, essentially starting your device. Unlocking the bootloader assists you in installing custom ROMs, flashing custom kernels, and rooting your phone.</p><p>However, this freedom comes with some trade-offs. Most manufacturers will void your warranty if you unlock the bootloader, and it can also make your phone face higher risks of malware and other security threats. Additionally, it can be difficult to relock the bootloader once you unlock it.</p><p>If you encounter the <strong>OEM unlock missing</strong> on your Android phone despite wanting to unlock your bootloader, this article can help. You will learn the step-by-step guide for the different methods to fix the <strong>missing OEM unlock</strong> option. Before diving into solutions, let’s explore why this option might be unavailable in the first place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-01.jpg"                      alt="using a phone at work"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?</h2><p>Finding that OEM Unlock is missing on your Android phones can be frustrating, particularly if you plan to modify your software or install a custom ROM. But don’t worry. There are several possible explanations for this. Let’s explore some of the most common reasons:</p><p>Manufacturer Restrictions</p><p>The <strong>Missing OEM Unlock</strong> option can often be due to restrictions imposed by your device’s manufacturers. They may intentionally remove this option to safeguard device security and compatibility. It is common with carrier-locked devices. As a result, the OEM Unlock option may not show.</p><p>Bootloader Already Unlocked</p><p>In some cases, the <strong>Android OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue arises <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-unlock-xiaomi-bootloader.html"><u>when the bootloader has already been unlocked</u></a>. Relocking the bootloader might make the option reappear. But exercise caution as this process can erase device data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-02.jpg"                      alt="oem unlock option greyed out"                ></p><p>Developer Options Not Enabled</p><p>It might seem obvious, but sometimes the simplest things get overlooked. The OEM Unlock option can only be accessed from within Developer Options. If this menu isn’t enabled, you won’t see it.</p><p>Carrier-Locked Devices</p><p>The <strong>OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue can also occur if your device is <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/carrier-unlock-android-phone.html"><u>carrier-locked</u></a>. Carriers often impose restrictions to prevent users from switching networks, and bootloader unlocking is one way to do that. Unfortunately, the <strong>missing OEM Unlock</strong> option is usually intentional, and unlocking your device can be more complicated.</p><p>Security Features</p><p>Enhanced security features, like Samsung’s KNOX, can sometimes conceal the OEM Unlock option. Temporarily turning off these features might show the option, but it’s crucial to be aware of the potential security implications of doing so.</p><p>Corrupted Bootloader</p><p>A corrupted bootloader can also lead to the <strong>Android OEM Unlock missing</strong> problem. The bootloader plays a role in the boot process, and if it’s damaged, it might not display the necessary options. This can be caused by software glitches, failed flashing attempts, or even <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-run-a-hardware-test-on-xiaomi.html"><u>hardware issues</u></a>. In this scenario, you might need to consult your device’s manufacturer or a technical specialist to help repair or re-flash the bootloader.</p><p>Connectivity Issues</p><p>A poor connection between your device and computer can also prevent the OEM Unlocking from showing up. Check your cables and try using different USB ports to ensure a stable connection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?"></a>Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?</h2><p>Unlocking your phone’s bootloader (OEM Unlock) varies across models and brands. Some need a passcode or PIN after rebooting the phone, while others don’t. Even if your phone doesn’t require a separate password, your existing screen lock (password, PIN, pattern) will usually be needed to enable the <strong>missing OEM unlock</strong> option.</p><p>But what if you forgot that, too? <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> - Screen Unlock can help bypass forgotten passwords and unlock your phone even if you don’t have the technical knowledge.

But if the Android OEM unlock option is missing, you can’t unlock your device’s bootloader. Below is a step-by-step guide for you so the <strong>OEM unlock missing</strong> option will show in the Developer Options. Remember, this process may erase your device data, so a complete backup is essential before proceeding.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your Android phone.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>About Phone</strong> at the bottom of the list, then tap <strong>Software information</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-08.jpg"                      alt="software information settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap on the <strong>Build number</strong> repeatedly (7 times) until you see a message saying, “<strong>You are now a developer!</strong>“ or similar.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> and find the <strong>Developer options</strong> menu.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Scroll down and tap the toggle switch next to <strong>Enable OEM Unlock</strong> to turn it on.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-09.jpg"                      alt="enable oem unlock developer option"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> A warning message explaining the risks of turning on the OEM unlock will appear.

On all most all the android device, you’ll notice a lock mostly on the right side (sometimes on top) of a round charm. You just have to direct towards the lock and then the lock screen will be unlocked in no time. This method doesn’t provide any security (it just protects your device from sudden access by tapping on screen or any of the button) to your device as no password or PIN is required to set the “Slide” unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-3.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Keep your any finger on the middle of the round charm and by keeping your finger pressed, reach on the lock icon. The lock screen will be unlocked just after reaching your finger to the lock icon.</p><h3 id="2-Face-Unlock"><a href="#2-Face-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="2.Face Unlock"></a>2.Face Unlock</h3><p>This method of unlocking your lock screen needs your Android device to snap a photo of your with its camera. After you set the snapped photo as the unlocking recognition, you could unlock your device through showing your face on the screen.</p><p>Capture a picture of your face with your Android device’s camera and then set it for logging in into your device. From the lock screen, by just by holding your face, you can log in. It’s very interesting, but you should never rely on this method for strong security as this method of unlocking is prone to break easily as an intruder can unlock your device by putting a photo of you in front of your device. Moreover, this method sometimes doesn’t work properly. So it’s better to go for some other highly secured options for locking your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-4.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="3-Pattern"><a href="#3-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="3.Pattern"></a>3.Pattern</h3><p>This is a way of setting pattern for lock screen from a grid of nine dots. You can select the pattern like some letter like Z, L or C etc, but nothing guarantees high security as the set pattern can be easily guessed or be seen while you are unlocking your device. Another problem is that by unlocking with the same pattern, your finger leaves some marks for the pattern’s path. By following the path, a stranger can unlock your device. So for little security, you can use pattern unlock method on your Android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-5.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for Pattern and then set the pattern by sliding your finger from one dot to another, then another and like that way. Remember which pattern you’ve set in order to unlock your device in the next time.</p><h3 id="4-PIN"><a href="#4-PIN" class="headerlink" title="4.PIN"></a>4.PIN</h3><p>You might be troubled by thinking about the difference between PIN and Password. A little distinction is there for a PIN and that is it consists of numbers only whereas for password, you can associate some alphabetical letters or signs along with numbers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-6.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for PIN and then set a PIN that consists of minimum 4 digits. It’s your choice to use 4 or more digit PIN. After setting the PIN, you can access your Android device by putting the PIN in a box from the lock screen. PIN protected lock screen is highly protected if the PIN is set strongly.</p><h3 id="5-Password"><a href="#5-Password" class="headerlink" title="5.Password"></a>5.Password</h3><p>In addition to PIN protection, you can consider it as password by adding some letters, special characters with the previously selected PIN codes. It’s also very much highly protected method of locking screen though you might be bored with tapping for the password again and again. But never ignore the value of your device’s files, so a password can be a well-sought lock screen protection for many users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-7.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="6-Fingerprint"><a href="#6-Fingerprint" class="headerlink" title="6.Fingerprint"></a>6.Fingerprint</h3><p>In some of the modern Android device, you’ll find the feature of fingerprint unlocking. You can find the option through the screen or any dedicated button. By setting your fingerprint, you can unlock your device by tapping your finger on the Honor 100 Pro device’s screen or the dedicated button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-8.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="7-Voice"><a href="#7-Voice" class="headerlink" title="7.Voice"></a>7.Voice</h3><p>This is also a fun way of unlocking Android lock screen as you can unlock by saying the same voice that you’ve saved as the unlocking recognition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-9.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the setting from “Voice Unlock” button and record your voice such as “Open My Honor 100 Pro” or as per your choice with clear sound. Repeat the voice a few more times as to match well. Then set and unlock your device from the lock screen by using the same voice command.</p><h2 id="Customize-Android-Lock-Screen"><a href="#Customize-Android-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Customize Android Lock Screen"></a>Customize Android Lock Screen</h2><p><strong>Lock Screen Widgets</strong></p><p>Widgets can be used from Android lock screen without unlocking the Honor 100 Pro device first. Also, because of this, any one who can access your phone can see your information from widgets. But since Lollipop update, widgets has been changed to Notifications on Android. Here, let’s see how to set customize widgets on Android running OS before lollipop.

So you can use them directly. For users of KitKat, you can go to Settings, select Security, and find Enable Widgets option. To add a new widget to the lock screen, swipe the screen from left to right until there is a plus on the screen. Tap the plus and select the widget you would like to add. You can also drag the widgets to repalce it.</p><p><strong>Smart Lock on Android</strong></p><p>Smart Lock is a new feature introduced in Lollipop.

Working on this service is quite straightforward, and it only works if the user has a Google account. This service is accessible and usable from any device or computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/android-device-manager-1.jpg"                      alt="unlock android screen 15"                ></p><p>There are a few things to keep in mind as you use this service to get around the lock screen.

Enter Recovery Mode to Hard Reset"></a>2. Enter Recovery Mode to Hard Reset</h3><p>If you can’t use the Find my device feature, you’ll have to factory reset physically. To do as such:</p><ul><li>Power your device off.</li><li>Hold the Volume (-) and power keys all the while after the screen goes dark to raise Android’s bootloader menu. This button blend might be different relying on your device model.</li><li>Press the Volume down button two times to feature the Recovery Mode choice. Then, at that point, press the power button to choose it.</li><li>Hold the power button and press the Volume up button to enter this mode.</li><li>Utilize the volume buttons to go to the Wipe data&#x2F;Factory Reset choice. Continue with the steps to play out a factory reset.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/what-is-my-phone-password-4.jpg"                      alt="wipe data"                ></p><h3 id="3-Use-ADB"><a href="#3-Use-ADB" class="headerlink" title="3.

Therefore, we suggest you back up everything on your Android before proceeding.</p><p>If your phone has USB debugging enabled, is connected to a PC, and is not encrypted, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Connect your device to your PC through a USB connector.</li><li>Open Command Prompt or Terminal window to your ADB installation registry.</li><li>Type in adb shell rm&#x2F;data&#x2F;system&#x2F;gesture.key and click the Enter key.</li><li>Reboot your phone. When you do, the solid lock screen ought to be gone.</li><li>That is not a permanent condition, so reset your PIN or password lock before you reboot your device once more. That’s how you reset <strong>password for phone.</strong></li></ul><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4.Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock"></a>4.Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock</h3><p>If you want to unlock your phone without losing any data, we suggest Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock.

It allows you to unlock your phone bootloader. A bootloader or bootstrap loader gathers the operating system files, loads them into memory, and hands over control, essentially starting your device. Unlocking the bootloader assists you in installing custom ROMs, flashing custom kernels, and rooting your phone.</p><p>However, this freedom comes with some trade-offs. Most manufacturers will void your warranty if you unlock the bootloader, and it can also make your phone face higher risks of malware and other security threats. Additionally, it can be difficult to relock the bootloader once you unlock it.</p><p>If you encounter the <strong>OEM unlock missing</strong> on your Android phone despite wanting to unlock your bootloader, this article can help. You will learn the step-by-step guide for the different methods to fix the <strong>missing OEM unlock</strong> option. Before diving into solutions, let’s explore why this option might be unavailable in the first place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-01.jpg"                      alt="using a phone at work"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?</h2><p>Finding that OEM Unlock is missing on your Android phones can be frustrating, particularly if you plan to modify your software or install a custom ROM. But don’t worry. There are several possible explanations for this. Let’s explore some of the most common reasons:</p><p>Manufacturer Restrictions</p><p>The <strong>Missing OEM Unlock</strong> option can often be due to restrictions imposed by your device’s manufacturers. They may intentionally remove this option to safeguard device security and compatibility. It is common with carrier-locked devices. As a result, the OEM Unlock option may not show.</p><p>Bootloader Already Unlocked</p><p>In some cases, the <strong>Android OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue arises <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-unlock-xiaomi-bootloader.html"><u>when the bootloader has already been unlocked</u></a>. Relocking the bootloader might make the option reappear. But exercise caution as this process can erase device data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-02.jpg"                      alt="oem unlock option greyed out"                ></p><p>Developer Options Not Enabled</p><p>It might seem obvious, but sometimes the simplest things get overlooked. The OEM Unlock option can only be accessed from within Developer Options. If this menu isn’t enabled, you won’t see it.</p><p>Carrier-Locked Devices</p><p>The <strong>OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue can also occur if your device is <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/carrier-unlock-android-phone.html"><u>carrier-locked</u></a>. Carriers often impose restrictions to prevent users from switching networks, and bootloader unlocking is one way to do that. Unfortunately, the <strong>missing OEM Unlock</strong> option is usually intentional, and unlocking your device can be more complicated.</p><p>Security Features</p><p>Enhanced security features, like Samsung’s KNOX, can sometimes conceal the OEM Unlock option. Temporarily turning off these features might show the option, but it’s crucial to be aware of the potential security implications of doing so.</p><p>Corrupted Bootloader</p><p>A corrupted bootloader can also lead to the <strong>Android OEM Unlock missing</strong> problem. The bootloader plays a role in the boot process, and if it’s damaged, it might not display the necessary options. This can be caused by software glitches, failed flashing attempts, or even <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-run-a-hardware-test-on-xiaomi.html"><u>hardware issues</u></a>. In this scenario, you might need to consult your device’s manufacturer or a technical specialist to help repair or re-flash the bootloader.</p><p>Connectivity Issues</p><p>A poor connection between your device and computer can also prevent the OEM Unlocking from showing up. Check your cables and try using different USB ports to ensure a stable connection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?"></a>Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?</h2><p>Unlocking your phone’s bootloader (OEM Unlock) varies across models and brands. Some need a passcode or PIN after rebooting the phone, while others don’t. Even if your phone doesn’t require a separate password, your existing screen lock (password, PIN, pattern) will usually be needed to enable the <strong>missing OEM unlock</strong> option.</p><p>But what if you forgot that, too? <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> - Screen Unlock can help bypass forgotten passwords and unlock your phone even if you don’t have the technical knowledge.

This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Google Pixel 7a device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Google Pixel 7a  device, you’ll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here’s how to remove the operator lock on a Google Pixel 7a :</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “*#*#7378423#*#*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg"                      alt="dial the provided number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is “X” before the “Network” option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of “Network” is 0, your device can’t be unlocked as it is hard-locked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg"                      alt="check the network status"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input “*#06#” on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Google Pixel 7a  device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-7.jpg"                      alt="enter the sim unlock code"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-How-to-Unlock-Bootloader"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-How-to-Unlock-Bootloader" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: How to Unlock Bootloader?"></a>Bonus Tip: How to Unlock Bootloader?</h2><p>Unlocking the bootloader on your Android device provides significant advantages. These actions encompass obtaining root access, installing custom ROMs, configuring custom recoveries, and carrying out advanced procedures. Here’s an essential guide on unlocking the bootloader of your Sony device while keeping all precautions in mind:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the process, verify the bootloader status for your Sony smartphone. On opening the “Dialer” app, dial the number “*#*#7378423#*#*“ and access the “Rooting Status” option within the “Service Provider” settings.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the bootloader status displays “Yes,” ensure that the Sony USB drivers and ADB tools are installed on your computer. Enable “USB Debugging” and “OEM Unlocking” on your smartphone and switch it off.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Connect the Google Pixel 7a  smartphone with a USB cable and press the “Power + Volume Up” keys for a few seconds. Open the Windows computer and access the “Devices and Printers” directory. Right-click on the “fastboot driver” file, select “Update,” and select the location of the “android_winbus.inf” file. Verify the fastboot connectivity through the CMD command.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Open the official “Sony Unlocking Site” and add in the IMEI number. On acknowledging, use the commands as follows: <code>adb reboot bootloader</code></p><p>Unlock the bootloader with the following command: <code>fastboot oem unlock 0x&lt;insert your unlock code</code></p><p>Verify the bootloader is unlocked and use the command to reboot the system; if not done automatically: <code>fastboot reboot</code></p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Forgetting your Google Pixel 7a  screen unlock password, PIN, or pattern is quite common. For such instances, there are several methods that you can use to unlock your screen, 5 of which we have discussed in this article.</p><p>If you’re looking for ways that are time-effective and reliable, you can use your Google account or other ways to unlock Google Pixel 7a  and set a new screen lock.
