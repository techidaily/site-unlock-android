Securing them with a PIN, passcode, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock has become the norm. It’s like putting a digital lock on our private world.</p><p>But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.</p><p>That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg"                      alt="android emergency call screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?</h2><p>The <strong>Android emergency call bypass</strong> method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html"><u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u></a>. It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.</p><p><strong>“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls</strong> be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html"><u>reset your password </u></a> through official channels.</p><h3 id="Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method"></a>Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method</h3><p>However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.</p><p>But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the <strong>emergency call bypass</strong> can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="android emergency screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen"></a>Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen</h2><p>Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important. Remember, this method exploits a security flaw and should be used as a last resort.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen"></a>Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen</h2><p>While the <strong>emergency call bypass for Android</strong> method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions.

Securing them with a PIN, passcode, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock has become the norm. It’s like putting a digital lock on our private world.</p><p>But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.</p><p>That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg"                      alt="android emergency call screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?</h2><p>The <strong>Android emergency call bypass</strong> method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html"><u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u></a>. It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.</p><p><strong>“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls</strong> be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html"><u>reset your password </u></a> through official channels.</p><h3 id="Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method"></a>Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method</h3><p>However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.</p><p>But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the <strong>emergency call bypass</strong> can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="android emergency screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen"></a>Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen</h2><p>Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important. Remember, this method exploits a security flaw and should be used as a last resort.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen"></a>Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen</h2><p>While the <strong>emergency call bypass for Android</strong> method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions. Modern devices have significantly improved security, making this method obsolete.

Securing them with a PIN, passcode, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock has become the norm. It’s like putting a digital lock on our private world.</p><p>But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.</p><p>That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg"                      alt="android emergency call screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?</h2><p>The <strong>Android emergency call bypass</strong> method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html"><u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u></a>. It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.</p><p><strong>“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls</strong> be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html"><u>reset your password </u></a> through official channels.</p><h3 id="Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method"></a>Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method</h3><p>However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.</p><p>But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the <strong>emergency call bypass</strong> can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="android emergency screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen"></a>Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen</h2><p>Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important. Remember, this method exploits a security flaw and should be used as a last resort.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen"></a>Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen</h2><p>While the <strong>emergency call bypass for Android</strong> method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions.

Securing them with a PIN, passcode, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock has become the norm. It’s like putting a digital lock on our private world.</p><p>But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.</p><p>That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg"                      alt="android emergency call screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?</h2><p>The <strong>Android emergency call bypass</strong> method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html"><u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u></a>. It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.</p><p><strong>“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls</strong> be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html"><u>reset your password </u></a> through official channels.</p><h3 id="Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method"></a>Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method</h3><p>However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.</p><p>But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the <strong>emergency call bypass</strong> can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="android emergency screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen"></a>Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen</h2><p>Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important. Remember, this method exploits a security flaw and should be used as a last resort.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen"></a>Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen</h2><p>While the <strong>emergency call bypass for Android</strong> method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions. Modern devices have significantly improved security, making this method obsolete.

You can perform this method if you have your Google account credentials and are ready. However, we want you to back up your data so you can sign once more after the reset and restore a ton of your data.</p><p>Since you’re locked out, you will have to utilize a technique to do the reset. The most straightforward way is to utilize Google’s Find My Device site. So, if the Find my Device option feature is enabled on your phone, you can tap the <strong>Erase device</strong> choice on this page to reset it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/what-is-my-phone-password-3.jpg"                      alt="google find my device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Enter-Recovery-Mode-to-Hard-Reset"><a href="#2-Enter-Recovery-Mode-to-Hard-Reset" class="headerlink" title="2.

To do as such:</p><ul><li>Power your device off.</li><li>Hold the Volume (-) and power keys all the while after the screen goes dark to raise Android’s bootloader menu. This button blend might be different relying on your device model.</li><li>Press the Volume down button two times to feature the Recovery Mode choice. Then, at that point, press the power button to choose it.</li><li>Hold the power button and press the Volume up button to enter this mode.</li><li>Utilize the volume buttons to go to the Wipe data&#x2F;Factory Reset choice.

Therefore, we suggest you back up everything on your Android before proceeding.</p><p>If your phone has USB debugging enabled, is connected to a PC, and is not encrypted, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Connect your device to your PC through a USB connector.</li><li>Open Command Prompt or Terminal window to your ADB installation registry.</li><li>Type in adb shell rm&#x2F;data&#x2F;system&#x2F;gesture.key and click the Enter key.</li><li>Reboot your phone.

Securing them with a PIN, passcode, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock has become the norm. It’s like putting a digital lock on our private world.</p><p>But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.</p><p>That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg"                      alt="android emergency call screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?</h2><p>The <strong>Android emergency call bypass</strong> method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html"><u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u></a>. It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.</p><p><strong>“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls</strong> be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html"><u>reset your password </u></a> through official channels.</p><h3 id="Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method"></a>Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method</h3><p>However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.</p><p>But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the <strong>emergency call bypass</strong> can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="android emergency screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen"></a>Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen</h2><p>Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important. Remember, this method exploits a security flaw and should be used as a last resort.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen"></a>Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen</h2><p>While the <strong>emergency call bypass for Android</strong> method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions.

It allows you to unlock your phone bootloader. A bootloader or bootstrap loader gathers the operating system files, loads them into memory, and hands over control, essentially starting your device. Unlocking the bootloader assists you in installing custom ROMs, flashing custom kernels, and rooting your phone.</p><p>However, this freedom comes with some trade-offs. Most manufacturers will void your warranty if you unlock the bootloader, and it can also make your phone face higher risks of malware and other security threats. Additionally, it can be difficult to relock the bootloader once you unlock it.</p><p>If you encounter the <strong>OEM unlock missing</strong> on your Android phone despite wanting to unlock your bootloader, this article can help. You will learn the step-by-step guide for the different methods to fix the <strong>missing OEM unlock</strong> option. Before diving into solutions, let’s explore why this option might be unavailable in the first place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-01.jpg"                      alt="using a phone at work"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?</h2><p>Finding that OEM Unlock is missing on your Android phones can be frustrating, particularly if you plan to modify your software or install a custom ROM. But don’t worry. There are several possible explanations for this. Let’s explore some of the most common reasons:</p><p>Manufacturer Restrictions</p><p>The <strong>Missing OEM Unlock</strong> option can often be due to restrictions imposed by your device’s manufacturers. They may intentionally remove this option to safeguard device security and compatibility. It is common with carrier-locked devices. As a result, the OEM Unlock option may not show.</p><p>Bootloader Already Unlocked</p><p>In some cases, the <strong>Android OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue arises <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-unlock-xiaomi-bootloader.html"><u>when the bootloader has already been unlocked</u></a>. Relocking the bootloader might make the option reappear. But exercise caution as this process can erase device data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-02.jpg"                      alt="oem unlock option greyed out"                ></p><p>Developer Options Not Enabled</p><p>It might seem obvious, but sometimes the simplest things get overlooked. The OEM Unlock option can only be accessed from within Developer Options. If this menu isn’t enabled, you won’t see it.</p><p>Carrier-Locked Devices</p><p>The <strong>OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue can also occur if your device is <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/carrier-unlock-android-phone.html"><u>carrier-locked</u></a>. Carriers often impose restrictions to prevent users from switching networks, and bootloader unlocking is one way to do that. Unfortunately, the <strong>missing OEM Unlock</strong> option is usually intentional, and unlocking your device can be more complicated.</p><p>Security Features</p><p>Enhanced security features, like Samsung’s KNOX, can sometimes conceal the OEM Unlock option. Temporarily turning off these features might show the option, but it’s crucial to be aware of the potential security implications of doing so.</p><p>Corrupted Bootloader</p><p>A corrupted bootloader can also lead to the <strong>Android OEM Unlock missing</strong> problem. The bootloader plays a role in the boot process, and if it’s damaged, it might not display the necessary options. This can be caused by software glitches, failed flashing attempts, or even <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-run-a-hardware-test-on-xiaomi.html"><u>hardware issues</u></a>. In this scenario, you might need to consult your device’s manufacturer or a technical specialist to help repair or re-flash the bootloader.</p><p>Connectivity Issues</p><p>A poor connection between your device and computer can also prevent the OEM Unlocking from showing up. Check your cables and try using different USB ports to ensure a stable connection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?"></a>Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?</h2><p>Unlocking your phone’s bootloader (OEM Unlock) varies across models and brands. Some need a passcode or PIN after rebooting the phone, while others don’t. Even if your phone doesn’t require a separate password, your existing screen lock (password, PIN, pattern) will usually be needed to enable the <strong>missing OEM unlock</strong> option.</p><p>But what if you forgot that, too? <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> - Screen Unlock can help bypass forgotten passwords and unlock your phone even if you don’t have the technical knowledge.

But if the Android OEM unlock option is missing, you can’t unlock your device’s bootloader. Below is a step-by-step guide for you so the <strong>OEM unlock missing</strong> option will show in the Developer Options. Remember, this process may erase your device data, so a complete backup is essential before proceeding.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your Android phone.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>About Phone</strong> at the bottom of the list, then tap <strong>Software information</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-08.jpg"                      alt="software information settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap on the <strong>Build number</strong> repeatedly (7 times) until you see a message saying, “<strong>You are now a developer!</strong>“ or similar.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> and find the <strong>Developer options</strong> menu.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Scroll down and tap the toggle switch next to <strong>Enable OEM Unlock</strong> to turn it on.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-09.jpg"                      alt="enable oem unlock developer option"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> A warning message explaining the risks of turning on the OEM unlock will appear.

It is, however, important to find a way to unlock the broken device so that you can gain access to your data and create a backup to restore to a new device.</p><p>In this article, we are going to look at a few simple ways you can unlock an Android device with a broken screen.</p><p><strong>Here is a video for you to learn how to unlock Android phone or access phone with broken screen:</strong></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KaWEiQhxBTQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Method-1-Using-Android-Debug-Bridge-ADB"><a href="#Method-1-Using-Android-Debug-Bridge-ADB" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Using Android Debug Bridge (ADB)"></a>Method 1: Using Android Debug Bridge (ADB)</h2><p>For this method, you will need your device and access to a PC. It is the most powerful method to unlock a broken Android device. It will however only work if you have enabled USB debugging on your android phone. If you haven’t, skip this method and see if method 2 or 3 might be of help.</p><p>ADB creates a bridge between the PC and your device which can then be used to unlock the Google Pixel 8 Pro device. Here’s how to use this bridge.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the Android SDK package on your PC. You can download it here: <a class="link"   href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" >http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Extract the ZIP file on your PC.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Download the necessary drivers for your device. The USB drivers for your device can be found on the manufacturer’s website.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Launch Command Prompt on your PC and change the location of the ADB file. Type in the following into Command Prompt; <em>cd C:&#x2F;android&#x2F;platform-tools</em></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Connect the Google Pixel 8 Pro device to your PC using USB cables. Enter the command “ ADB _device_” (without quotation marks). If your phone is recognized, you will see numbers in the Command Prompt message.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Type in the following two commands. You will need to type in the second one immediately after the first. Replace 1234 with your password.</p><p><em>ADB shell input text 1234</em><br><em>Shell input key event 66</em></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Your phone will now be unlocked and you can proceed to back up its contents.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/style/images/arrow_up.png"                      alt="arrow"                ></p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The Best Tool to Reset Phones Without Android Factory Reset Codes</p><ul><li>It enables your Android phones to get safe, simple, and trustful after reset.</li><li>It is still helpful even though you don’t know the OS version of your devices.</li><li>Everybody can handle it without any technical background.</li><li>Provide specific removal solutions to promise good success rate.</li></ul><p><strong>4,008,670</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Method-2-Using-a-USB-Mouse-and-the-On-the-Go-Adapter"><a href="#Method-2-Using-a-USB-Mouse-and-the-On-the-Go-Adapter" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using a USB Mouse and the On the Go Adapter"></a>Method 2: Using a USB Mouse and the On the Go Adapter</h2><p>This is a great solution if you don’t have USB debugging enabled on your device. You will need your device, an OTG adapter and a USB mouse. It involves connecting the Google Pixel 8 Pro device to the USB mouse using the OTG adapter. Check if your device can be connected to a USB mouse. You can find an OTG adapter online, they are relatively inexpensive and very useful.</p><p>Before we begin, it is a good idea to ensure your device is sufficiently charged because the Mouse may drain your battery.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect the Micro USB side of the OTG adapter to your device and then plug in the USB mouse to the adapter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531933625473.jpg"                      alt="connect broken screen android phone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As soon as the Google Pixel 8 Pro devices are connected, you will be able to see a pointer on your screen. You can then use the pointer to unlock the pattern or enter the Google Pixel 8 Pro device’s password lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531933791903.jpg"                      alt="unlock android with broken screen"                ></p><p>You can then go about backing up the contents of your device.</p><h2 id="Method-3-Using-your-Samsung-Account"><a href="#Method-3-Using-your-Samsung-Account" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using your Samsung Account"></a>Method 3: Using your Samsung Account</h2><p>This method is a reliable way to unlock a Samsung device that has a broken screen or is not working correctly.

Securing them with a PIN, passcode, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock has become the norm. It’s like putting a digital lock on our private world.</p><p>But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.</p><p>That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg"                      alt="android emergency call screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?</h2><p>The <strong>Android emergency call bypass</strong> method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html"><u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u></a>.

Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html"><u>reset your password </u></a> through official channels.</p><h3 id="Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method"></a>Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method</h3><p>However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.</p><p>But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the <strong>emergency call bypass</strong> can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="android emergency screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen"></a>Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen</h2><p>Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important.

This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models.

Securing them with a PIN, passcode, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock has become the norm. It’s like putting a digital lock on our private world.</p><p>But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.</p><p>That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg"                      alt="android emergency call screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?</h2><p>The <strong>Android emergency call bypass</strong> method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html"><u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u></a>.

Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html"><u>reset your password </u></a> through official channels.</p><h3 id="Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method"></a>Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method</h3><p>However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.</p><p>But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the <strong>emergency call bypass</strong> can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="android emergency screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen"></a>Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen</h2><p>Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important. Remember, this method exploits a security flaw and should be used as a last resort.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen"></a>Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen</h2><p>While the <strong>emergency call bypass for Android</strong> method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions.

Securing them with a PIN, passcode, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock has become the norm. It’s like putting a digital lock on our private world.</p><p>But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.</p><p>That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg"                      alt="android emergency call screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?</h2><p>The <strong>Android emergency call bypass</strong> method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html"><u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u></a>. It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.</p><p><strong>“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls</strong> be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html"><u>reset your password </u></a> through official channels.</p><h3 id="Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method"></a>Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method</h3><p>However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.</p><p>But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models.

Securing them with a PIN, passcode, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock has become the norm. It’s like putting a digital lock on our private world.</p><p>But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.</p><p>That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg"                      alt="android emergency call screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?</h2><p>The <strong>Android emergency call bypass</strong> method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html"><u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u></a>. It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.</p><p><strong>“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls</strong> be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html"><u>reset your password </u></a> through official channels.</p><h3 id="Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method"></a>Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method</h3><p>However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.</p><p>But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the <strong>emergency call bypass</strong> can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="android emergency screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen"></a>Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen</h2><p>Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important. Remember, this method exploits a security flaw and should be used as a last resort.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen"></a>Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen</h2><p>While the <strong>emergency call bypass for Android</strong> method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions. Modern devices have significantly improved security, making this method obsolete.

Disconnect the Google Pixel Fold  device from the PC and turn the Google Pixel Fold device off completely. Press the volume down button along with the power button to switch the Google Pixel Fold device on in bootloader mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/12/14822589729198.jpg"                      alt="htc unlock bootloader"                ></p><p>Step 5: Use the volume keys of the Google Pixel Fold device to select Fastboot option along with pressing power button to confirm, after the Google Pixel Fold device is in bootloader mode. Now, connect the Google Pixel Fold device to the computer using a USB cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/12/14822588941681.jpg"                      alt="htc unlock bootloader"                ></p><p>Step 6: Go to Fastboot folder on the PC and holding down the shift key, click on any empty space followed by a click on “Open command window here”.</p><p>Step 7: In the command prompt window, type “fastboot devices” and press enter.

However, pattern locks are easy to crack, and today, we bring you all you want to know about pattern locks and how to create a <strong>hard pattern lock</strong>. Further to this, we also tell you how to move beyond pattern locks and what to do in case you forgot the hard pattern lock you just set and are unable to unlock your smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="creating more secure pattern locks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks"></a>Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks</h2><p>Pattern lock is an Android-only feature that makes it easy for users to have a modicum of security on their smartphones. Most users do not prefer using and remembering a PIN to unlock the smartphone. Creating a pattern makes it easier, somehow.</p><p>There is a 9-point grid on which you swipe your finger from point to point, in any direction, and when you take your finger off, that pattern you swiped becomes the key to unlock your smartphone.</p><p>Pattern locks were exceedingly common only a few years ago, and they are not recommended for use any longer due to concerns (mentioned later in the article).</p><h3 id="1-1-Popularity-and-Usage"><a href="#1-1-Popularity-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="1.1: Popularity and Usage"></a>1.1: Popularity and Usage</h3><p>Old habits die hard, or so they say, right? That’s because it is true. We are creatures of habit, and pattern locks have been around for a long, long time. We are accustomed to pattern locks. So, even with even easier technologies such as fingerprint recognition and face recognition, we tend to gravitate towards the familiar old pattern lock.</p><p>The only thing is, there is a reason why pattern locks are no longer the preferred option to use for unlocking your smartphones. As it happens, that reason is security, and it can be very easy for humans to take a swipe (pardon the pun) at your pattern lock. And guess what? The research conducted suggests that they would get it right with an unsettling accuracy.</p><h3 id="1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>With on-the-go lifestyles, our smartphones have become indispensable and contain some of the most sensitive aspects of our lives – IDs, credit and debit cards in digital wallets, photo and video memories, business documents – you name it, the smartphones have it, on the go. This has opened our lives up to the public at large, and if someone steals our smartphone or, best case, finds it, the only barrier preventing them from being privy to all that wealth of our sensitive information is that screen lock – the pattern lock that we set on our smartphones. That’s it – the single pattern lock stands between malicious actors and our data. You might be beginning to realize just how crazy this is.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There are two advantages to using pattern locks. One, they are better than nothing. Two, they are easy to use. And that’s about it. There is no third advantage to pattern locks. We might think we set a hard pattern lock that nobody could guess, but, as research proves, we might be thinking too low of human prowess.</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>Security, or rather, the lack of it, is the lone disadvantage of using a pattern lock. What good is a pattern lock that can be easily deciphered? Sure, they are easy to use, and they are better than not having anything, but would you really want to protect your life’s data with something that could be, as researchers found out, breached in under 5 attempts? We don’t think you do!</p><p>The research found that 64% of test subjects who were shown videos of people unlocking their phones could correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock, that too after viewing the video only once! That number shot up to 80% if they were allowed to see the video again. That is simply astounding and a nightmare for security. When it comes to PINs, only 11% could guess a 6-digit PIN after viewing the unlocking video once, and that number shot up to 27% when they could see the video two times.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)"></a>Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)</h2><p>Now, if you must continue using a pattern lock, let’s help you know how to create a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy to decipher as easy pattern locks.

In case your fingerprint is not recognized for any reason, the phone falls back on the 6-digit PIN that you can enter and unlock your phone.</p><p>While face recognition is available on both Android and Apple devices, it is truly secure only on Apple devices.

Securing them with a PIN, passcode, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock has become the norm. It’s like putting a digital lock on our private world.</p><p>But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.</p><p>That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg"                      alt="android emergency call screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?</h2><p>The <strong>Android emergency call bypass</strong> method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html"><u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u></a>. It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.</p><p><strong>“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls</strong> be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html"><u>reset your password </u></a> through official channels.</p><h3 id="Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method"></a>Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method</h3><p>However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.</p><p>But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the <strong>emergency call bypass</strong> can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="android emergency screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen"></a>Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen</h2><p>Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important. Remember, this method exploits a security flaw and should be used as a last resort.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Other-Ways-To-Unlock-Your-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen"></a>Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen</h2><p>While the <strong>emergency call bypass for Android</strong> method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions. Modern devices have significantly improved security, making this method obsolete. There are other, more reliable methods for those needing to unlock their phone’s screen.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Wondershare-Dr-Fone-–-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#Method-1-Wondershare-Dr-Fone-–-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Wondershare Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock"></a>Method 1: Wondershare Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock</h3><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> is a comprehensive software solution for various mobile issues, including screen unlocking.

Learn how to unlock the Tecno phone if forgot your password using Android Device Manager.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Start by logging in to <a class="link"   href="https://www.google.co.in/android/devicemanager" >Android Device Manager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by entering the credentials of your respective Google Account that is configured with your phone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892201986480.jpg"                      alt="unlock lg forgot password - login android device manager"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select your device’s icon to get access to various features like ring, lock, erase, and more. Out of all the provided options, click on “<strong>lock</strong>” to change the security lock of your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892202439511.jpg"                      alt="unlock lg forgot password - select device"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, a new pop-up window will open.

The provision is not available on devices, which run on newer versions of Android. Nevertheless, for all the Tecno Phantom V Fold devices running on older versions than Android 4.4, this is undoubtedly the easiest way to set a new passcode. Follow these steps to learn how to unlock your Tecno phone if you forgot your password using your Google credentials.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Try bypassing the pattern lock at least 5 times. After all the failed attempts, you will get the option to either make an emergency call or choose the option of “<strong>Forget pattern</strong>”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892203178747.jpg"                      alt="unlock lg forgot password - forgot pattern"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the “Forget pattern” option and provide the correct credentials of your Google account to unlock your phone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892203377058.jpg"                      alt="unlock lg forgot password - log in google account"                ></p><h2 id="Solution-4-Unlock-the-Tecno-Phone-Using-Custom-Recovery-SD-card-needed"><a href="#Solution-4-Unlock-the-Tecno-Phone-Using-Custom-Recovery-SD-card-needed" class="headerlink" title="Solution 4: Unlock the Tecno Phone Using Custom Recovery (SD card needed)"></a>Solution 4: Unlock the Tecno Phone Using Custom Recovery (SD card needed)</h2><p>If your phone has a removable SD card, you can also try this technique to disable the pattern&#x2F;password on your device. Though, you need to have some custom recovery installed on your device for this method. You can always go for TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project) and flash it on your device.</p><p>TWRP: <a class="link"   href="https://twrp.me/" >https://twrp.me/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Also, since you can’t move anything to your device when it is locked, you need to do the same using its SD card.

Now, insert your SD card into your system and move the recently downloaded file to it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Reboot your phone into recovery mode. For instance, the TWRP recovery mode can be turned on by simultaneously pressing the Power, Home, and Volume Up button. You would get different options on your screen after entering the custom recovery mode. Tap on “Install” and browse the Pattern Password Disable application file.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892204165153.jpg"                      alt="unlock lg forgot password - team win recovery project"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Install the above-mentioned application and wait for a few minutes.

This will erase every kind of data from your device and make it look brand new by resetting it. Though, you can easily resolve the forgot password on the Tecno phone with it. Therefore, before proceeding, you need to be familiar with all the repercussions of performing a factory reset. All you got to do is follow these steps.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Put your Tecno phone on its recovery mode with correct key combinations. To do this, firstly, turn your device off and let it rest for a few seconds. Now, press the Power and Volume Down key at the same time. Keep pressing them until you see LG’s logo on the screen. Release the buttons for a few seconds and press them again at the same time. Again, keep pressing the buttons until you see the recovery mode menu. This technique works with most Tecno devices, but it can differ slightly from one model to another.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Choose “Wipe Data&#x2F;Factory Reset.” You can use the Volume up and down key to navigate the options and the power&#x2F;home key to select anything. Use these keys and select the “Wipe Data&#x2F;Factory Reset” option. You might get another pop-up asking to delete all user data. Just agree it reset your device.

Securing them with a PIN, passcode, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock has become the norm. It’s like putting a digital lock on our private world.</p><p>But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.</p><p>That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg"                      alt="android emergency call screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?</h2><p>The <strong>Android emergency call bypass</strong> method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html"><u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u></a>.

Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html"><u>reset your password </u></a> through official channels.</p><h3 id="Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method"></a>Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method</h3><p>However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.</p><p>But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the <strong>emergency call bypass</strong> can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models.

Here’s How You Can Unlock Honor X9b Pattern Lock Screen</h2><p>Forgetting the pattern lock of a device and getting locked out of it is probably one of the most frustrating scenarios faced by Android users. Nevertheless, unlike popular operating systems, Android provides a seamless way to past the forgot pattern lock feature.</p><p>You can either try Google’s native solution or a third-party tool in case you have forgotten the pattern lock on your device and reset it. In no time, you will be able to access your device (or even someone else’s phone by following these techniques). To make things easier for you, we have provided three simple solutions to resolve forgotten patterns on Android devices.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/68FqgS6Ym8E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-bypass-forgot-pattern-lock-using-the-‘Forgot-Pattern’-feature"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-bypass-forgot-pattern-lock-using-the-‘Forgot-Pattern’-feature" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the ‘Forgot Pattern’ feature?"></a>Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the ‘Forgot Pattern’ feature?</h2><p>One of the easiest and fastest ways to fix the forgot pattern lock issue on a device is by using its inbuilt “Forgot Pattern” feature. If you are using an Android 4.4 or earlier version, then you can simply access this feature. Since users can hack an Android device just by knowing the Google credentials of the connected device, the solution was later discontinued (as it was considered a security vulnerability). Nevertheless, if your device hasn’t been updated and you are using an Android 4.4 or previous version, then you can bypass the forgot pattern lock by following these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On the same prompt, you can see an option of “Forgot pattern” on the bottom. Simply tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059289368742.jpg"                      alt="forgot pattern"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> This will open a new screen, which can be used to bypass the forgotten pattern of Android. Select the option for entering the Google Account details and proceed.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> To reset the forgot pattern lock, you need to provide the correct Google credentials of the account already linked to the Honor X9b device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059290192675.jpg"                      alt="enter google account"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> After signing in to the interface, you will be asked to provide a new pattern lock for the Honor X9b device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059290477717.jpg"                      alt="draw an unlock pattern"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Confirm your choice and set a new pattern lock on your device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-get-past-forgot-pattern-lock-using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-get-past-forgot-pattern-lock-using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to get past forgot pattern lock using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)?"></a>Part 2: How to get past forgot pattern lock using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)?</h2><p>One of the major drawbacks of the “Forgot pattern” feature is that it doesn’t work on new Android devices.

But you can try to reset your Google account first.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)"></a>Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)</h2><p>Even if you have a Google account, if your phone isn’t connected to the internet, you cannot access it to unlock your phone. If this sounds familiar, you can always try this method.</p><p>1. First, navigate to the Android Device Manager page. You will need to sign in with the Google account that you use to set up your phone.</p><p>Android Device Manager link: <a class="link"   href="http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager" >http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942446007.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager log in"                ></p><p>2.

It allows you to unlock your phone bootloader. A bootloader or bootstrap loader gathers the operating system files, loads them into memory, and hands over control, essentially starting your device. Unlocking the bootloader assists you in installing custom ROMs, flashing custom kernels, and rooting your phone.</p><p>However, this freedom comes with some trade-offs. Most manufacturers will void your warranty if you unlock the bootloader, and it can also make your phone face higher risks of malware and other security threats. Additionally, it can be difficult to relock the bootloader once you unlock it.</p><p>If you encounter the <strong>OEM unlock missing</strong> on your Android phone despite wanting to unlock your bootloader, this article can help. You will learn the step-by-step guide for the different methods to fix the <strong>missing OEM unlock</strong> option. Before diving into solutions, let’s explore why this option might be unavailable in the first place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-01.jpg"                      alt="using a phone at work"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?</h2><p>Finding that OEM Unlock is missing on your Android phones can be frustrating, particularly if you plan to modify your software or install a custom ROM. But don’t worry. There are several possible explanations for this. Let’s explore some of the most common reasons:</p><p>Manufacturer Restrictions</p><p>The <strong>Missing OEM Unlock</strong> option can often be due to restrictions imposed by your device’s manufacturers. They may intentionally remove this option to safeguard device security and compatibility. It is common with carrier-locked devices. As a result, the OEM Unlock option may not show.</p><p>Bootloader Already Unlocked</p><p>In some cases, the <strong>Android OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue arises <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-unlock-xiaomi-bootloader.html"><u>when the bootloader has already been unlocked</u></a>. Relocking the bootloader might make the option reappear. But exercise caution as this process can erase device data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-02.jpg"                      alt="oem unlock option greyed out"                ></p><p>Developer Options Not Enabled</p><p>It might seem obvious, but sometimes the simplest things get overlooked. The OEM Unlock option can only be accessed from within Developer Options. If this menu isn’t enabled, you won’t see it.</p><p>Carrier-Locked Devices</p><p>The <strong>OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue can also occur if your device is <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/carrier-unlock-android-phone.html"><u>carrier-locked</u></a>. Carriers often impose restrictions to prevent users from switching networks, and bootloader unlocking is one way to do that. Unfortunately, the <strong>missing OEM Unlock</strong> option is usually intentional, and unlocking your device can be more complicated.</p><p>Security Features</p><p>Enhanced security features, like Samsung’s KNOX, can sometimes conceal the OEM Unlock option. Temporarily turning off these features might show the option, but it’s crucial to be aware of the potential security implications of doing so.</p><p>Corrupted Bootloader</p><p>A corrupted bootloader can also lead to the <strong>Android OEM Unlock missing</strong> problem. The bootloader plays a role in the boot process, and if it’s damaged, it might not display the necessary options. This can be caused by software glitches, failed flashing attempts, or even <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-run-a-hardware-test-on-xiaomi.html"><u>hardware issues</u></a>. In this scenario, you might need to consult your device’s manufacturer or a technical specialist to help repair or re-flash the bootloader.</p><p>Connectivity Issues</p><p>A poor connection between your device and computer can also prevent the OEM Unlocking from showing up. Check your cables and try using different USB ports to ensure a stable connection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?"></a>Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?</h2><p>Unlocking your phone’s bootloader (OEM Unlock) varies across models and brands. Some need a passcode or PIN after rebooting the phone, while others don’t. Even if your phone doesn’t require a separate password, your existing screen lock (password, PIN, pattern) will usually be needed to enable the <strong>missing OEM unlock</strong> option.</p><p>But what if you forgot that, too? <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> - Screen Unlock can help bypass forgotten passwords and unlock your phone even if you don’t have the technical knowledge.

Securing them with a PIN, passcode, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock has become the norm. It’s like putting a digital lock on our private world.</p><p>But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.</p><p>That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg"                      alt="android emergency call screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?</h2><p>The <strong>Android emergency call bypass</strong> method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html"><u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u></a>.

Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html"><u>reset your password </u></a> through official channels.</p><h3 id="Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method"></a>Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method</h3><p>However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.</p><p>But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the <strong>emergency call bypass</strong> can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="android emergency screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen"></a>Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen</h2><p>Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models.

This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html"><u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u></a>.

Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html"><u>reset your password </u></a> through official channels.</p><h3 id="Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method"></a>Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method</h3><p>However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.</p><p>But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the <strong>emergency call bypass</strong> can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="android emergency screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen"></a>Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen</h2><p>Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="android tap to add emergency contacts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (*). Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models.
