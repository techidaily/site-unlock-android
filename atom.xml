This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Honor Magic 6 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Honor Magic 6  device, you’ll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here’s how to remove the operator lock on a Honor Magic 6 :</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “*#*#7378423#*#*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg"                      alt="dial the provided number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is “X” before the “Network” option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of “Network” is 0, your device can’t be unlocked as it is hard-locked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg"                      alt="check the network status"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input “*#06#” on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Honor Magic 6  device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-7.jpg"                      alt="enter the sim unlock code"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-How-to-Unlock-Bootloader"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-How-to-Unlock-Bootloader" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: How to Unlock Bootloader?"></a>Bonus Tip: How to Unlock Bootloader?</h2><p>Unlocking the bootloader on your Android device provides significant advantages.

On opening the “Dialer” app, dial the number “*#*#7378423#*#*“ and access the “Rooting Status” option within the “Service Provider” settings.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the bootloader status displays “Yes,” ensure that the Sony USB drivers and ADB tools are installed on your computer. Enable “USB Debugging” and “OEM Unlocking” on your smartphone and switch it off.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Connect the Honor Magic 6  smartphone with a USB cable and press the “Power + Volume Up” keys for a few seconds. Open the Windows computer and access the “Devices and Printers” directory. Right-click on the “fastboot driver” file, select “Update,” and select the location of the “android_winbus.inf” file. Verify the fastboot connectivity through the CMD command.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Open the official “Sony Unlocking Site” and add in the IMEI number. On acknowledging, use the commands as follows: <code>adb reboot bootloader</code></p><p>Unlock the bootloader with the following command: <code>fastboot oem unlock 0x&lt;insert your unlock code</code></p><p>Verify the bootloader is unlocked and use the command to reboot the system; if not done automatically: <code>fastboot reboot</code></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Forgetting your Honor Magic 6  screen unlock password, PIN, or pattern is quite common.

This button blend might be different relying on your device model.</li><li>Press the Volume down button two times to feature the Recovery Mode choice.

It is the most powerful method to unlock a broken Android device. It will however only work if you have enabled USB debugging on your android phone. If you haven’t, skip this method and see if method 2 or 3 might be of help.</p><p>ADB creates a bridge between the PC and your device which can then be used to unlock the Honor Magic 6 device. Here’s how to use this bridge.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the Android SDK package on your PC. You can download it here: <a class="link"   href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" >http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

If your phone is recognized, you will see numbers in the Command Prompt message.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Type in the following two commands. You will need to type in the second one immediately after the first.

You will need your device, an OTG adapter and a USB mouse. It involves connecting the Honor Magic 6 device to the USB mouse using the OTG adapter. Check if your device can be connected to a USB mouse. You can find an OTG adapter online, they are relatively inexpensive and very useful.</p><p>Before we begin, it is a good idea to ensure your device is sufficiently charged because the Mouse may drain your battery.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect the Micro USB side of the OTG adapter to your device and then plug in the USB mouse to the adapter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531933625473.jpg"                      alt="connect broken screen android phone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As soon as the Honor Magic 6 devices are connected, you will be able to see a pointer on your screen.

While it is highly effective you will need to have a Samsung account registered with your device. The problem is that not many Samsung device users have registered their devices with the service. If you are among the lucky few who have, here’s how to use your account to unlock your device.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the <a class="link"   href="https://findmymobile.samsung.com/login.do" >https://findmymobile.samsung.com/login.do <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your PC or any other device and log in with your account information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531933993021.jpg"                      alt="unlock android with broken screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select your device from the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You should see the option “Unlock my screen” on the sidebar. Click on it and you will get instructions on how to access your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531934188479.jpg"                      alt="unlock android using samsung account"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Being unable to unlock your device is never a good place to be.

To reach the lock screen settings android, you’ve to follow the path:</p><p>Options – Security – Screen Lock – Choose Screen Lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-1.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Now see how to unlock your lock screen in different ways.</p><h3 id="1-Slide"><a href="#1-Slide" class="headerlink" title="1.Slide"></a>1.Slide</h3><p>This is the most common method of unlocking an android lock screen. On all most all the android device, you’ll notice a lock mostly on the right side (sometimes on top) of a round charm. You just have to direct towards the lock and then the lock screen will be unlocked in no time. This method doesn’t provide any security (it just protects your device from sudden access by tapping on screen or any of the button) to your device as no password or PIN is required to set the “Slide” unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-3.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Keep your any finger on the middle of the round charm and by keeping your finger pressed, reach on the lock icon. The lock screen will be unlocked just after reaching your finger to the lock icon.</p><h3 id="2-Face-Unlock"><a href="#2-Face-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="2.Face Unlock"></a>2.Face Unlock</h3><p>This method of unlocking your lock screen needs your Android device to snap a photo of your with its camera. After you set the snapped photo as the unlocking recognition, you could unlock your device through showing your face on the screen.</p><p>Capture a picture of your face with your Android device’s camera and then set it for logging in into your device. From the lock screen, by just by holding your face, you can log in. It’s very interesting, but you should never rely on this method for strong security as this method of unlocking is prone to break easily as an intruder can unlock your device by putting a photo of you in front of your device. Moreover, this method sometimes doesn’t work properly. So it’s better to go for some other highly secured options for locking your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-4.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="3-Pattern"><a href="#3-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="3.Pattern"></a>3.Pattern</h3><p>This is a way of setting pattern for lock screen from a grid of nine dots. You can select the pattern like some letter like Z, L or C etc, but nothing guarantees high security as the set pattern can be easily guessed or be seen while you are unlocking your device. Another problem is that by unlocking with the same pattern, your finger leaves some marks for the pattern’s path. By following the path, a stranger can unlock your device. So for little security, you can use pattern unlock method on your Android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-5.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for Pattern and then set the pattern by sliding your finger from one dot to another, then another and like that way. Remember which pattern you’ve set in order to unlock your device in the next time.</p><h3 id="4-PIN"><a href="#4-PIN" class="headerlink" title="4.PIN"></a>4.PIN</h3><p>You might be troubled by thinking about the difference between PIN and Password. A little distinction is there for a PIN and that is it consists of numbers only whereas for password, you can associate some alphabetical letters or signs along with numbers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-6.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for PIN and then set a PIN that consists of minimum 4 digits. It’s your choice to use 4 or more digit PIN. After setting the PIN, you can access your Android device by putting the PIN in a box from the lock screen. PIN protected lock screen is highly protected if the PIN is set strongly.</p><h3 id="5-Password"><a href="#5-Password" class="headerlink" title="5.Password"></a>5.Password</h3><p>In addition to PIN protection, you can consider it as password by adding some letters, special characters with the previously selected PIN codes. It’s also very much highly protected method of locking screen though you might be bored with tapping for the password again and again. But never ignore the value of your device’s files, so a password can be a well-sought lock screen protection for many users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-7.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="6-Fingerprint"><a href="#6-Fingerprint" class="headerlink" title="6.Fingerprint"></a>6.Fingerprint</h3><p>In some of the modern Android device, you’ll find the feature of fingerprint unlocking. You can find the option through the screen or any dedicated button. By setting your fingerprint, you can unlock your device by tapping your finger on the Honor Magic 6 Lite device’s screen or the dedicated button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-8.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="7-Voice"><a href="#7-Voice" class="headerlink" title="7.Voice"></a>7.Voice</h3><p>This is also a fun way of unlocking Android lock screen as you can unlock by saying the same voice that you’ve saved as the unlocking recognition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-9.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the setting from “Voice Unlock” button and record your voice such as “Open My Honor Magic 6 Lite” or as per your choice with clear sound.

Nothing could be more frustrating than gazing at your phone, knowing that it is essentially a paperweight at this point. Unless you can get it unlocked, your phone is useless, and all of your important photos, text messages, and content are all locked out of your reach. While right now, nothing can do without a Google account. But you can try to reset your Google account first.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)"></a>Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)</h2><p>Even if you have a Google account, if your phone isn’t connected to the internet, you cannot access it to unlock your phone. If this sounds familiar, you can always try this method.</p><p>1. First, navigate to the Android Device Manager page. You will need to sign in with the Google account that you use to set up your phone.</p><p>Android Device Manager link: <a class="link"   href="http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager" >http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942446007.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager log in"                ></p><p>2. Once you have logged in, you will automatically be redirected to the Android Device Manager page. If this is your first time, click the “Accept” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942473262.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager start"                ></p><p>3. A list of all of the Honor 90 GT devices registered to this Android account will pop up. Select the Honor 90 GT device in question from this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942503282.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager list of devices"                ></p><p>4. The Android Device Manager will then locate your device. Make sure it is turned on!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942532352.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager locating device"                ></p><p>5. After it has been located, you will have a few options for what to do next. If you do not know your phone’s location, you can call it from this screen, but if you know where it is, click the ‘Enable Lock &amp; Erase’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942568385.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager device located"                ></p><p>6. A notification will pop up on your device; confirm it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942582896.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager Erase &amp; Lock"                ></p><p>7. At this point, you will be asked to create a new lock screen password. Once you have chosen one, press “Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637943377629.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager New Lock Screen"                ></p><p>8.

It will open, and you can get back to your daily routine.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone"></a>Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone</h2><p>If you have forgotten your Google Account password, it is still possible to unlock your account and access the information within. Here is how you can unlock your Google account on your Android phone.</p><p>1. On your browser, go to the Google home page and try to sign in. You will fail, but that is good! It will lead you to the next step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535742329.jpg"                      alt="android Google web page"                ></p><p>2. Since you cannot sign in on the sign-in page, you can now select the ‘Help’ link.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535763672.jpg"                      alt="android Goodle log in"                ></p><p>3.

You will be prompted to enter your email address to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535788151.jpg"                      alt="android Google trouble signing in"                ></p><p>4. Two options will then appear: the first is your phone number, and the other asks you for your backup email.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535828239.jpg"                      alt="android Google forgot password"                ><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535857339.jpg"                      alt="android Google forgot pssword enter email"                ></p><p>5. Enter either one of these options, and you will receive a verification code via email, SMS, or a telephone call from an operator. If you have chosen to enter your backup email, at this point, you will receive detailed instructions on how to access the ‘reset password’ page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637561923476.jpg"                      alt="android Google automated call verification"                ><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637561995841.jpg"                      alt="android Google automated call verification"                ></p><p>6.

It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.</p><p>FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Honor 90 GT device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.</p><p>While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary.

However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Honor 90  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the Honor 90 device and its password.</p><p>Here’s how to unlock the Honor 90  pattern lock without losing data using your Google account:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enter the incorrect PIN, pattern, or password 5 times, and click on “Forgot Password” or “Forgot Pattern.”</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> The interface will then ask you to enter your Google account details as an alternate option.

This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Honor 90 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Honor 90  device, you’ll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here’s how to remove the operator lock on a Honor 90 :</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “*#*#7378423#*#*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg"                      alt="dial the provided number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Carefully check the information provided on the screen.

To learn how to set up a lock screen pattern on an Android device, simply follow these steps:</p><ul><li>1. Firstly, unlock your device and go to its Settings. You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.</li><li>2. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.</li><li>3. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378431872.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-unlock your device"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378838236.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-Under the personal or privacy section"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379016188.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-access Lock Screen and Security"                ></p><ul><li>4. To set up a pattern lock screen, tap on the “Screen lock type” feature.</li><li>5. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none. In “Swipe”, you can unlock a device just by swiping the screen. Whereas, in pattern, pin, or password, you would be needed to provide the respective pattern&#x2F;pin&#x2F;password to unlock the Honor 90 Pro device.</li><li>6. We recommend setting up a lock screen pattern instead. To do this, tap on the “Pattern” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379466607.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-tap on the “Screen lock type” feature"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/15057379692063.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen- provide the respective pattern"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379835226.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-tap on the “Pattern” option"                ></p><ul><li>7.

We recommend using a strong screen lock pattern to provide unmatched security to your device.</li><li>8. Furthermore, you need to confirm your choice and provide the same pattern once again. Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.</li><li>9. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well.

It is the most powerful method to unlock a broken Android device. It will however only work if you have enabled USB debugging on your android phone. If you haven’t, skip this method and see if method 2 or 3 might be of help.</p><p>ADB creates a bridge between the PC and your device which can then be used to unlock the Honor Magic 5 Pro device. Here’s how to use this bridge.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the Android SDK package on your PC. You can download it here: <a class="link"   href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" >http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

You will need your device, an OTG adapter and a USB mouse. It involves connecting the Honor Magic 5 Pro device to the USB mouse using the OTG adapter. Check if your device can be connected to a USB mouse. You can find an OTG adapter online, they are relatively inexpensive and very useful.</p><p>Before we begin, it is a good idea to ensure your device is sufficiently charged because the Mouse may drain your battery.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect the Micro USB side of the OTG adapter to your device and then plug in the USB mouse to the adapter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531933625473.jpg"                      alt="connect broken screen android phone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As soon as the Honor Magic 5 Pro devices are connected, you will be able to see a pointer on your screen.

While it is highly effective you will need to have a Samsung account registered with your device. The problem is that not many Samsung device users have registered their devices with the service. If you are among the lucky few who have, here’s how to use your account to unlock your device.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the <a class="link"   href="https://findmymobile.samsung.com/login.do" >https://findmymobile.samsung.com/login.do <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your PC or any other device and log in with your account information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531933993021.jpg"                      alt="unlock android with broken screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select your device from the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You should see the option “Unlock my screen” on the sidebar. Click on it and you will get instructions on how to access your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531934188479.jpg"                      alt="unlock android using samsung account"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Being unable to unlock your device is never a good place to be. We hope one of the above solutions will work for you. You can then gain access to your device and back up the files and contacts. This way your life doesn’t have to be disrupted- you can just restore the backup on a new device or the old one once the screen is fixed.</p><h2 id="Best-Honor-Magic-5-Pro-Pattern-Lock-Removal-Tools-Remove-Android-Pattern-Lock-Without-Losing-Data"><a href="#Best-Honor-Magic-5-Pro-Pattern-Lock-Removal-Tools-Remove-Android-Pattern-Lock-Without-Losing-Data" class="headerlink" title="Best Honor Magic 5 Pro Pattern Lock Removal Tools: Remove Android Pattern Lock Without Losing Data"></a>Best Honor Magic 5 Pro Pattern Lock Removal Tools: Remove Android Pattern Lock Without Losing Data</h2><p>In the digital age, our smartphones have become an integral part of our lives.

You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.</li><li>2. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.</li><li>3. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378431872.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-unlock your device"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378838236.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-Under the personal or privacy section"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379016188.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-access Lock Screen and Security"                ></p><ul><li>4.

Nothing could be more frustrating than gazing at your phone, knowing that it is essentially a paperweight at this point. Unless you can get it unlocked, your phone is useless, and all of your important photos, text messages, and content are all locked out of your reach. While right now, nothing can do without a Google account. But you can try to reset your Google account first.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)"></a>Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)</h2><p>Even if you have a Google account, if your phone isn’t connected to the internet, you cannot access it to unlock your phone. If this sounds familiar, you can always try this method.</p><p>1. First, navigate to the Android Device Manager page. You will need to sign in with the Google account that you use to set up your phone.</p><p>Android Device Manager link: <a class="link"   href="http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager" >http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942446007.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager log in"                ></p><p>2. Once you have logged in, you will automatically be redirected to the Android Device Manager page. If this is your first time, click the “Accept” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942473262.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager start"                ></p><p>3. A list of all of the Honor 90 Pro devices registered to this Android account will pop up. Select the Honor 90 Pro device in question from this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942503282.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager list of devices"                ></p><p>4. The Android Device Manager will then locate your device. Make sure it is turned on!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942532352.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager locating device"                ></p><p>5. After it has been located, you will have a few options for what to do next. If you do not know your phone’s location, you can call it from this screen, but if you know where it is, click the ‘Enable Lock &amp; Erase’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942568385.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager device located"                ></p><p>6. A notification will pop up on your device; confirm it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942582896.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager Erase &amp; Lock"                ></p><p>7. At this point, you will be asked to create a new lock screen password. Once you have chosen one, press “Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637943377629.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager New Lock Screen"                ></p><p>8. Now, simply enter the new passcode on your device, and voila! It will open, and you can get back to your daily routine.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone"></a>Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone</h2><p>If you have forgotten your Google Account password, it is still possible to unlock your account and access the information within. Here is how you can unlock your Google account on your Android phone.</p><p>1. On your browser, go to the Google home page and try to sign in. You will fail, but that is good! It will lead you to the next step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535742329.jpg"                      alt="android Google web page"                ></p><p>2.
