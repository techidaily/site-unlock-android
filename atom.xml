This allows users to customize their devices extensively. However, despite this openness, certain features and capabilities can still be locked or restricted, either by Google or the Google Pixel Fold device manufacturer.</p><p>For those looking to truly unleash the full potential of their Android device, an OEM unlock is an essential step. This article will delve into the process of <strong>OEM unlocking on Android</strong>, guiding you through its benefits and how to safely perform it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-01.jpg"                      alt="android phone with padlock"                ></p><p><strong>OEM lock</strong> might sound like technical jargon to many. However, it’s a key concept for those who wish to dive deeper into Android customization. OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer. Unlocking in this context refers to removing restrictions made by the manufacturer on the Google Pixel Fold device.</p><p>This process allows you to gain deeper access to the Google Pixel Fold device’s software. Thus, OEM unlocking is often required for customizing or modifying the system at a more advanced level.</p><h3 id="Why-Enable-OEM-Unlock"><a href="#Why-Enable-OEM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Why Enable OEM Unlock?"></a>Why Enable OEM Unlock?</h3><p>The primary reason to enable <strong>OEM unlocking</strong> is to gain the ability to root your device or install custom firmware, also known as ROMs. Rooting is the Android equivalent of jailbreaking. It allows users to access and modify the Google Pixel Fold device’s software at the deepest level.</p><p>This can enable the installation of apps and software that require more permissions than what is typically available. On the other hand, custom ROMs can change your device’s interface. They can also add features not available in the stock version of Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-02.jpg"                      alt="android oem unlocking settings"                ></p><h3 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-OEM-Unlocking"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-OEM-Unlocking" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of OEM Unlocking"></a>Pros and Cons of OEM Unlocking</h3><p>Here are some great things you can get when you <strong>allow OEM unlock.</strong></p><ul><li>The most significant advantage is the ability to customize your device far beyond what’s possible with standard settings.</li><li><strong>Root access.</strong> It allows for rooting the phone enabling advanced features and apps.</li><li><strong>Custom ROMs.</strong> Users can install different versions of Android or entirely new operating systems.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, here are some cons that you must consider before performing the process on your phone:</p><ul><li><strong>Security risks.</strong> Root access can make your device more vulnerable to malware and hacking.</li><li><strong>Void warranty.</strong> OEM unlocking often voids the manufacturer’s warranty.</li><li><strong>Potential for bricking.</strong> Incorrect procedures can render the Google Pixel Fold device unusable, known as ‘bricking’.</li></ul><h3 id="Understanding-the-Risks"><a href="#Understanding-the-Risks" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Risks"></a>Understanding the Risks</h3><p>It’s crucial to understand that OEM unlocking is not without its risks. It does open the door to several customizations and tweaks. However, it can also compromise the security of your device. There’s always a chance of bricking your phone, especially if the unlocking process isn’t followed correctly or an unstable custom ROM is installed.</p><p>Additionally, most manufacturers will void your warranty once you unlock the bootloader. This leaves you without support in case something goes wrong. So, in the next sections, you’ll be guided through the steps of OEM unlocking. You’ll also learn how to do it safely, ensuring you make the most out of your Android device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Enable-OEM-Unlock-on-Your-Android-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Enable-OEM-Unlock-on-Your-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Enable OEM Unlock on Your Android Phone"></a>Part 2: How To Enable OEM Unlock on Your Android Phone</h2><p><strong>Enabling OEM unlock</strong> can feel like stepping into uncharted territory. Still, it’s relatively straightforward if you follow the right steps. Before you start, it’s important to remember that the exact process can vary slightly depending on your device’s brand and model. However, the general steps are usually similar across most Android devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-03.jpg"                      alt="android developer options"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Before proceeding, ensure you <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup/android-backup-software.html"><u>back up all important data</u></a>. Enabling OEM unlock may require a factory reset, which erases all data on the Google Pixel Fold device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings &gt; About Phone. Then, tap on the Build number seven times. You should see a message that says you’re now a developer.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find and select Developer options on Settings. Then, tap <strong>OEM unlocking</strong>. You might need to enter a PIN or password.</li></ul><p>Here are some common links where you might find the needed PIN or password:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.htcdev.com/bootloader/"><u>HTC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://developer.lge.com/resource/mobile/RetrieveBootloader.dev?categoryTypeCode=ANRS"><u>LG</u></a></li><li><a href="https://developer.sonymobile.com/unlockbootloader/unlock-yourboot-loader/"><u>Sony</u></a></li><li><a href="https://community.gethuawei.com/developers/f/48/t/1048"><u>Huawei</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.motorola.com/https://accounts.motorola.com/ssoauth/login?TARGET=https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/cc/cas/sso/redirect/standalone/bootloader/unlock-your-device-b"><u>Motorola</u></a></li><li><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-unlock-codes.html"><u>Samsung</u></a></li></ul><p>After these steps, your device’s bootloader is now unlocked, and you can proceed with rooting or installing custom ROMs. Remember that this is a significant change to your device’s system, and it should be done cautiously and ideally only if you’re comfortable with potential risks.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Can-You-Do-After-OEM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-What-Can-You-Do-After-OEM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Can You Do After OEM Unlock?"></a>Part 3: What Can You Do After OEM Unlock?</h2><p>Unlocking your phone’s OEM opens up a world of possibilities. It allows you to customize your device beyond what’s available in its factory settings. This newfound freedom, however, comes with its own set of responsibilities and risks. Here’s what you can do after having your phone <strong>OEM unlocked</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-04.jpg"                      alt="android custom roms"                ></p><h3 id="Root-Your-Device"><a href="#Root-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Root Your Device"></a>Root Your Device</h3><p>Rooting is akin to having the master key to your device’s software. It allows you to gain superuser access, enabling modifications and access to system files that were previously restricted. With rooting, you can:</p><ul><li>Remove pre-installed apps or bloatware.</li><li>Customize system settings and UI elements.</li><li>Enhance performance or battery life through underclocking or overclocking the CPU.</li></ul><h3 id="Flash-a-Custom-ROM"><a href="#Flash-a-Custom-ROM" class="headerlink" title="Flash a Custom ROM"></a>Flash a Custom ROM</h3><p>A custom ROM is a new operating system you can install on your device. This is one of the most popular reasons for OEM unlocking. Custom ROMs offer:</p><ul><li>The latest Android updates, even for older devices, are no longer supported by manufacturers.</li><li>New features and customization options that aren’t available in the stock ROM.</li><li>Potential performance improvements and unique user interfaces.</li></ul><h3 id="Enjoy-High-Customization"><a href="#Enjoy-High-Customization" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy High Customization"></a>Enjoy High Customization</h3><p>With an OEM unlocked device, the sky’s the limit regarding customization. You can:</p><ul><li>Install custom kernels for better performance and battery life.</li><li>Use powerful apps that require root access for advanced device management.</li><li>Customize everything from the boot animation to the layout of your UI.</li></ul><p>However, it’s crucial to proceed with caution. Rooting and installing custom ROMs can void your warranty and, if not done correctly, can turn your device into an expensive paperweight (a state often referred to as “bricking”). Always use reliable sources for your custom ROMs and root-access apps.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-To-Unlock-Your-Android-Screen-When-You-Forgot-Password"><a href="#Bonus-How-To-Unlock-Your-Android-Screen-When-You-Forgot-Password" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How To Unlock Your Android Screen When You Forgot Password"></a>Bonus: How To Unlock Your Android Screen When You Forgot Password</h2><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/guide-to-unlock-mi-account-without-password.html"><u>Forgetting the password </u></a> to your Android phone can be a stressful experience.

One of the frequently brought up problems is the lock screen and the unlocking mechanism itself. With a lot of phones, it can be quite sluggish and slow. There are many applications that change the lock screen both from a style and a functionality standpoint, and some of them are quite impressive. A quality Android unlock screen app allows you to customize it while possessing the main characteristics that you are looking for in any good application.</p><p>There are a lot of apps like that these days, and choosing between them is not always an easy task. Let’s take a look at the best 10 unlock apps for android.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android-1"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android-1" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Remove Android lock screen in 5 minutes</p><ul><li>Pattern, PIN, password, fingerprints &amp; face screen lock can all be unlocked.</li><li>Bypass Android FRP lock without a PIN or Google account.</li><li>No tech knowledge asked, everybody can handle it.</li><li>Unlock mainstream Android brands like Samsung, Huawei, LG, Xiaomi, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3,981,454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="1-Hi-Locker"><a href="#1-Hi-Locker" class="headerlink" title="1.Hi Locker"></a>1.Hi Locker</h2><p>Hi Locker offers a similar style to CyanogeMod’s lock screen both from an aesthetics and functionality standpoint. It has all the looks of the most popular devices including Lollipop and iOS, as well as a second screen containing the calendar and many more goodness. If you are looking for unlock apps for Android, Hi Locker is clearly one of the best choices.</p><p>Hi Locker allows password and pattern unlocking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/05/14631657268767.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-Hi Locker"                ></p><h2 id="2-Lok-Lok"><a href="#2-Lok-Lok" class="headerlink" title="2.Lok Lok"></a>2.Lok Lok</h2><p>Lok Lok has a unique take on the locking screen application niche, allowing you to send drawings to people who use the same application. It has the basic functions of course but it really is only fan when others you know, use the same app as well. This fact kind of restricts this otherwise excellent application but the idea is genius. An Android unlock screen app that allows your creative side to shine through.</p><p>This Android unlock app doesn’t allow pin lock screen at the moment, it can be unlocked with the home button</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/05/14631658028688.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-Lok Lok"                ></p><h2 id="3-Next-News-Lock-Screen"><a href="#3-Next-News-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="3.Next News Lock Screen"></a>3.Next News Lock Screen</h2><p>When you are looking for unlock apps for android, you don’t necessarily think about reading the news, yet many times you would go to lengths to find them. What if the news you find the most interesting would appear on your lock screen? Would that be something you’d interested be in? If the answer is yes, this Android unlock screen app is for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/05/14631658526635.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-Next News Lock Screen"                ></p><h2 id="4-CM-Locker"><a href="#4-CM-Locker" class="headerlink" title="4.CM Locker"></a>4.CM Locker</h2><p>A very interesting application with a slide-to-unlock feature that’s eerily similar to iPhone devices. The app allows you to control several main phone functions including but not limited to brightness, WiFi, sound or Bluetooth. One of the most versatile unlock apps for Android.</p><p>This android unlock app allows pin and pattern unlock, and it also has an intruder alert (the phone locks and takes a photo when somebody unsuccessfully tries to unlock it).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/05/14631659122551.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-CM Locker"                ></p><h2 id="5-Slidelock-Locker"><a href="#5-Slidelock-Locker" class="headerlink" title="5.Slidelock Locker"></a>5.Slidelock Locker</h2><p>Another app that takes advantage of Apple’s popularity by bringing in the “slide-to-unlock” mechanics and the general aesthetic qualities of the iOS home screen. In addition to possessing the basic functions, this Android unlock screen app also highlights messages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/05/14631659338843.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-Slidelock Locker"                ></p><h2 id="6-Semper"><a href="#6-Semper" class="headerlink" title="6.Semper"></a>6.Semper</h2><p>This Android unlock app was once called UnlockYourBrain and it is quite unique in the way that it will make you work for your phone time. This may sound ridiculous at first, but actually a very clever idea and naturally emergency numbers can be called at all times.</p><p>Google Play link: <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.unlockyourbrain&hl=en" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.unlockyourbrain&hl=en <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>How to unlock : Solve a problem or an equation to unlock the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/05/14631659402691.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-semper"                ></p><h2 id="7-Next-Lock-Screen"><a href="#7-Next-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="7.Next Lock Screen"></a>7.Next Lock Screen</h2><p>Next Lock Screen is a cross platform unlock app that’s compatible with the complete Android ecosystem, making it one of the most valuable unlock apps for Android on the market. As a Microsoft product, it likes to advertise some of their other applications but this feature can thankfully be turned off. The notifications are clearly Microsoft quality which is not necessarily something that can be said about your average Android unlock screen app.</p><p>How to unlock : Pin,swipe or pattern.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/next-lock-screen.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-Next Lock Screen"                ></p><h2 id="8-AcDisplay"><a href="#8-AcDisplay" class="headerlink" title="8.AcDisplay"></a>8.AcDisplay</h2><p>AcDisplay comes with a rather minimalistic look similar to some of the most popular web site creator services like Squarespace or Wix. The home screen will highlight notifications for which it will offer two options, either you swipe down in which case you will ignore the notification, or swipe anywhere else and the lock screen will unlock. What’s really great about this Android unlock app is the fact that it can use your device’s sensors, allowing it to detect its placement therefore whether or not it should be on or off.</p><p>Google Play link: <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.achep.acdisplay&hl=en" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.achep.acdisplay&hl=en <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>How to unlock : You can swipe anywhere on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/05/14631660873877.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-AcDisplay"                ></p><h2 id="9-C-Locker-Pro"><a href="#9-C-Locker-Pro" class="headerlink" title="9.C Locker Pro"></a>9.C Locker Pro</h2><p>It would be unjust to call it an Android unlock app, this application is actually a carefully selected package that allows you to do a lot of cools stuff with your new and improved home screen. Not only it supports the usually methods of unlocking like swipe or patterns, but you can actually set double or even triple tap options which is quite unique and a very good idea. The app has every other usual options including setting your favorite apps or showing the lock, as well as the date and the temperature of course.</p><p>Google Play link: <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccs.lockscreen_pro&hl=en" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccs.lockscreen_pro&amp;hl&#x3D;en <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>How to unlock : This Android unlock screen app allows you to unlock the screen with swiping, patterns or even specific number of taps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/c-locker-pro.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-C Locker Pro"                ></p><h2 id="10-Echo-Notificaiton-Lockscreen"><a href="#10-Echo-Notificaiton-Lockscreen" class="headerlink" title="10.

Echo Notificaiton Lockscreen</h2><p>Another minimalistic design that works quite well, it also allows you to set different notification categories like “work”, “media” or “social”. Not only that, but you can also choose various apps to go with those categories. Messages come through as well of course, all with a “slide to unlock” feature that is so popular these days.</p><p>How to unlock : Slide right like you would with an iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/echo-notificaiton-lockscreen.jpg"                      alt="unlock apps for android-Echo Notificaiton Lockscreen"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus Tips:</strong> Easily bypass Android Lock Screen&#x2F;Google FRP on Android with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Even though modern Android smartphones come with fingerprint recognition and face recognition technologies, there exists a large subset of users still addicted to and acclimatized with the pattern lock feature, opting over fingerprint and face recognition.</p><p>There has been, however, research conducted into the safety and security offered by pattern lock in Android.</p><h3 id="I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>Modern smartphones very nearly contain the entirety of our lives; photo memories, video memories, important documents both financial and personal in nature, banking apps, ID and ATM&#x2F; credit cards in the “wallet” apps, and whatnot. A smartphone falling into the wrong hands could very nearly be used to devastate the rightful owner, both financially and otherwise. And this is not a claim out of thin air; spyware&#x2F; malware&#x2F; phishing attacks are on the rise around the world. Locking the smartphone, once considered optional and an unnecessary hassle, is now an absolute must.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There is no denying that using an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> to lock their smartphone seems enough for most users. Swiping your finger across your smartphone to unlock it feels not only cool and futuristic but safer and more secure than remembering and punching in digits. And, for the most part, it is true, given that 4-digit PINs can only have 10,000 unique combinations!</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>While very easy to use, security researchers and experts have come to agree that the feature is not in the least safe to use, and that is because of how people use the pattern lock feature (discussed in detail below in part II). Some go so far as to say that most pattern locks can be breached in just 5 attempts or less. Imagine that!</p><p>What is more, research has found that humans have an uncanny ability to correctly guess a pattern lock simply by viewing the unlocking! The test comprised showing the test subjects videos of users unlocking their phones from different angles and varying distances, and it was found that around 64% of test subjects were able to correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock in one viewing only, and 80% could correctly guess the pattern after just two viewings. By contrast, only 11% were able to correctly deduce a 6-digit PIN after one viewing, and only 27% after viewing twice. This goes to show just how insecure pattern locks are!</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks"></a>Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks</h2><p>We might wonder how anyone would be able to guess the correct pattern of our device, but believe it or not, it is possible, eerily easily at that! We are all the same humans, after all! You know how people usually set PINs that could be significant dates in their lives? How they get car registration numbers that mean something to them? The same ‘logic’ applies to their setting pattern locks.</p><p>At DEFCON 23, Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, presented something that stunned people around the world. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.” What followed was an expert presentation outlining and detailing user behaviors around pattern locks.</p><p>These are some commonly created pattern locks by people:</p><ul><li>- shapes of alphabets,</li><li>- shapes of numerals,</li><li>- any other easy-to-make, simple shape.</li></ul><p>Marte Loge presented the image below, showing how people naturally gravitate towards creating simple shape patterns, in her research.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-2.jpg"                      alt="common pattern locks"                ></p><p>To further help you see how easy it might be for anyone to guess your pattern, Marte Loge also presented some statistics.</p><ul><li>- 77% of people started their patterns in one of the 4 corners.</li><li>- 44% of Loge’s subjects started their pattern with the first dot, the top-left one. The next number was 15% for the top-right and 14% for the bottom-left.</li><li>- These percentages did not vary much depending on left-handedness or right-handedness.</li><li>- On average, irrespective of gender, people set 5-point patterns, with 4-point patterns being the most common. This means that the number of combinations on average was 7152 for 5-point patterns and a bogglingly low 1624 for 4-point patterns.</li></ul><p>The above data makes it amply clear how using an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> is actually worse than using a 4-digit PIN, simply because how people are usually using the pattern lock feature.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Tips-For-Using-More-Secure-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-III-Tips-For-Using-More-Secure-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks"></a>Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks</h2><p>Now, we know how hard it is to break habits cemented over years of use, so in case you must at all costs use a pattern lock only, the least you can do is try and change your easy pattern lock to a better, more secure hard pattern lock.</p><h4 id="III-I-How-to-Create-More-Secure-Patterns"><a href="#III-I-How-to-Create-More-Secure-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns"></a>III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns</h4><p>Here are some tips to help you create a better, more secure pattern lock for your smartphone.</p><ul><li>- Avoid using any of the corners to start the pattern.</li><li>- Never use your first initial as a pattern.</li><li>- Never use a digit shape as a pattern.</li><li>- You can pass through the same pattern lines multiple times over. This makes it more difficult for someone to guess your pattern correctly.</li><li>- Use all 9 points on the grid while setting the pattern lock! That simple act takes the possible pattern combinations to over 140,000, significantly more than 10,000 for 4-digit PINs, and vastly superior to paltry 1624 for a 4-point <strong>easy pattern lock</strong>!</li></ul><h4 id="III-II-Forgot-Your-Pattern-Unlock-Your-Google-Pixel-8-Without-Pattern-Lock-With-Dr-Fone"><a href="#III-II-Forgot-Your-Pattern-Unlock-Your-Google-Pixel-8-Without-Pattern-Lock-With-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="III.II: Forgot Your Pattern?

Tips, Tricks and Helpful Advice</h2><p>They have been along for a long, long time now – pattern locks – the easiest of all smartphone locks. You just swipe your finger across to create an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> of your choosing and that’s it, it becomes your new screen lock. No more remembering tedious digits! So, why have these easy pattern locks become outdated, and why do people still continue to use them? Let’s take a dive and find out all about pattern locks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="creating more secure pattern locks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-Things-To-Know-About-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-I-Things-To-Know-About-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks"></a>Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks</h2><p>The first cellphone locks were 4-digit number locks. Then came 6-digit codes, and even alphanumeric ones. Pattern locks were all the rage a while ago. Though pattern locks continue to be used, they are not considered safe to use any longer. What is all that about? Here’s what you need to know about pattern locks, whether you are a seasoned pattern lock user or not.</p><h3 id="I-I-What-Are-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#I-I-What-Are-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?"></a>I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?</h3><p>Believe it or not, technology has advanced at such a rapid pace in the last two decades that you’d be forgiven if you don’t know what a pattern lock is, especially if you have only ever used iPhones, or Android phones in just the last few years.</p><p>Pattern locks are patterns you create on your smartphone and designate as a smartphone lock&#x2F; screen lock. There is a 9-point keypad of sorts, and you start swiping your finger from any point to any point for any which way you feel like. Android 13 allows a minimum of 4 points registered. They are easy to create, and easy to use, hence called easy pattern locks.</p><p>Pattern locks have only ever been offered on Android devices and were commonplace a few years ago until they were deemed not secure enough for use by modern standards because they were <em>easy</em> to figure out by malicious actors.</p><h3 id="I-II-Popularity-and-Usage"><a href="#I-II-Popularity-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="I.II: Popularity and Usage"></a>I.II: Popularity and Usage</h3><p>Pattern lock is a feature unique to Android and has been so since the start. Naturally, it is one of the preferred ways users have come to unlock their Android devices over the years. Even though modern Android smartphones come with fingerprint recognition and face recognition technologies, there exists a large subset of users still addicted to and acclimatized with the pattern lock feature, opting over fingerprint and face recognition.</p><p>There has been, however, research conducted into the safety and security offered by pattern lock in Android.</p><h3 id="I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>Modern smartphones very nearly contain the entirety of our lives; photo memories, video memories, important documents both financial and personal in nature, banking apps, ID and ATM&#x2F; credit cards in the “wallet” apps, and whatnot. A smartphone falling into the wrong hands could very nearly be used to devastate the rightful owner, both financially and otherwise. And this is not a claim out of thin air; spyware&#x2F; malware&#x2F; phishing attacks are on the rise around the world. Locking the smartphone, once considered optional and an unnecessary hassle, is now an absolute must.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There is no denying that using an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> to lock their smartphone seems enough for most users. Swiping your finger across your smartphone to unlock it feels not only cool and futuristic but safer and more secure than remembering and punching in digits. And, for the most part, it is true, given that 4-digit PINs can only have 10,000 unique combinations!</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>While very easy to use, security researchers and experts have come to agree that the feature is not in the least safe to use, and that is because of how people use the pattern lock feature (discussed in detail below in part II). Some go so far as to say that most pattern locks can be breached in just 5 attempts or less. Imagine that!</p><p>What is more, research has found that humans have an uncanny ability to correctly guess a pattern lock simply by viewing the unlocking! The test comprised showing the test subjects videos of users unlocking their phones from different angles and varying distances, and it was found that around 64% of test subjects were able to correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock in one viewing only, and 80% could correctly guess the pattern after just two viewings. By contrast, only 11% were able to correctly deduce a 6-digit PIN after one viewing, and only 27% after viewing twice. This goes to show just how insecure pattern locks are!</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks"></a>Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks</h2><p>We might wonder how anyone would be able to guess the correct pattern of our device, but believe it or not, it is possible, eerily easily at that! We are all the same humans, after all! You know how people usually set PINs that could be significant dates in their lives? How they get car registration numbers that mean something to them? The same ‘logic’ applies to their setting pattern locks.</p><p>At DEFCON 23, Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, presented something that stunned people around the world. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.” What followed was an expert presentation outlining and detailing user behaviors around pattern locks.</p><p>These are some commonly created pattern locks by people:</p><ul><li>- shapes of alphabets,</li><li>- shapes of numerals,</li><li>- any other easy-to-make, simple shape.</li></ul><p>Marte Loge presented the image below, showing how people naturally gravitate towards creating simple shape patterns, in her research.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-2.jpg"                      alt="common pattern locks"                ></p><p>To further help you see how easy it might be for anyone to guess your pattern, Marte Loge also presented some statistics.</p><ul><li>- 77% of people started their patterns in one of the 4 corners.</li><li>- 44% of Loge’s subjects started their pattern with the first dot, the top-left one. The next number was 15% for the top-right and 14% for the bottom-left.</li><li>- These percentages did not vary much depending on left-handedness or right-handedness.</li><li>- On average, irrespective of gender, people set 5-point patterns, with 4-point patterns being the most common. This means that the number of combinations on average was 7152 for 5-point patterns and a bogglingly low 1624 for 4-point patterns.</li></ul><p>The above data makes it amply clear how using an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> is actually worse than using a 4-digit PIN, simply because how people are usually using the pattern lock feature.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Tips-For-Using-More-Secure-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-III-Tips-For-Using-More-Secure-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks"></a>Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks</h2><p>Now, we know how hard it is to break habits cemented over years of use, so in case you must at all costs use a pattern lock only, the least you can do is try and change your easy pattern lock to a better, more secure hard pattern lock.</p><h4 id="III-I-How-to-Create-More-Secure-Patterns"><a href="#III-I-How-to-Create-More-Secure-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns"></a>III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns</h4><p>Here are some tips to help you create a better, more secure pattern lock for your smartphone.</p><ul><li>- Avoid using any of the corners to start the pattern.</li><li>- Never use your first initial as a pattern.</li><li>- Never use a digit shape as a pattern.</li><li>- You can pass through the same pattern lines multiple times over. This makes it more difficult for someone to guess your pattern correctly.</li><li>- Use all 9 points on the grid while setting the pattern lock! That simple act takes the possible pattern combinations to over 140,000, significantly more than 10,000 for 4-digit PINs, and vastly superior to paltry 1624 for a 4-point <strong>easy pattern lock</strong>!</li></ul><h4 id="III-II-Forgot-Your-Pattern-Unlock-Your-Honor-X50i-Without-Pattern-Lock-With-Dr-Fone"><a href="#III-II-Forgot-Your-Pattern-Unlock-Your-Honor-X50i-Without-Pattern-Lock-With-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="III.II: Forgot Your Pattern?

Android seems to be controlling a considerably high portion of our life. We have bought many gadgets that use this amazing OS and most of which are phones. But how much can you do with your Android phone? Developers are always making it more interesting to use this interface.</p><p>Most of the time, we use Android phones, we get faced with the need to access the internet. The Wi-Fi capability of these Android gadgets makes it super easy for us to surf the web. Throughout using Wi-Fi, we connect to a number of them. This could be at school, a sub-way café, the gym, buses, hospitals, hotels, towns, and the list is endless. A password secures most of this. Needless to say, our brain is weak to store all these passwords for future use, especially if you would want to connect with a different gadget you have recently bought or even your laptop. In this article, we will introduce you to how to find wifi password on rooted and also unrooted Android devices.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/78mNMIr_wpI"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Rooted-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Rooted-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device"></a>Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device</h2><h3 id="What-is-Rooting"><a href="#What-is-Rooting" class="headerlink" title="What is Rooting?"></a>What is Rooting?</h3><p>First of all, what does rooting mean? You have probably used a Windows computer or even Linux. For the case of Windows, when installing a new program or software, it always prompts a dialog box saying, “Administrator permission required to run this program.” If you don’t have the administrator permission, you won’t install the program. In Android, this is called rooting. In simple terms, it means having the root permission to your phone. Some Android apps will require you the root permission, e.g., flashing your ROM. In this part, we will explain how you can show the Wi-Fi password on your Android with root.</p><p>To find the Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone, you need to have an app to explore files which also supports a root user. In this case, ES FileExplorer or Root Explorer will come in handy. However, it turns out that the latter is offered at $3. Let’s use the free ES File Explorer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556285763404.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><h3 id="Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root"><a href="#Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root" class="headerlink" title="Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root"></a>Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root</h3><p>In only four steps, we, at this moment, learn how we can find the password of a Wi-Fi on an Android phone.</p><p>Step 1: Install the ES File Explorer</p><p>Download the ES File Explorer from your play store, install it, and open it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556286507084.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 2: Enable Root Explorer</p><p>The root explorer needs to be enabled so that you can reach the root folders of the Wi-Fi passwords you need.

You might mess up with important data and fail to access the Wi-Fi(s) in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556294042257.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>As you can see above, we have found the Wi-Fi passwords on the android device. On each network profile, we have the name of the network represented by <em>name (ssid&#x3D;”{the name}”)</em>, the network’s password represented by <em>psk</em>, the network’s access point represented by <em>key_mgmt&#x3D;WPA-PSK</em> and its priority represented by <em>priority</em>.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Android-without-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Android-without-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Show Wifi Password on Android without Root"></a>Part 2: Show Wifi Password on Android without Root</h2><p>What if I don’t have root access to my Android, can I still see Android Wi-Fi password? The short answer is yes. However, this is a bit involving but simple. You don’t need to be a computer guru to do it, but you need to have a computer and some internet access of course. The key thing is to find a way through which we can fetch the password file from the phone without using a root access protocol in the Android. This is made possible by some little programming insight using the Windows Command prompt.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-show-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-without-root"><a href="#Steps-to-show-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-without-root" class="headerlink" title="Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root"></a>Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root</h3><p>Step 1: Access the Developer authority</p><p>To access the files that Android uses to run passwords, you must first become a developer. This is very simple.</p><p>Get your Android phone and go to settings. Scroll down and find “About phone.” Tap on it and scroll down again to find Build number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556302638925.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Tap on this “build number” 5 to 6 times until a message pops up, saying, “You are now a developer”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556303263992.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 2: Enable the debugging.</p><p>Go back to Settings. Scroll down for developer options. Turn on the button for “Android&#x2F;USB debugging”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556308665697.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 3: Install ADB drivers.</p><p>Now, open your Windows desktop. Download and install ADB drivers. (Use this download link <a class="link"   href="http://adbdriver.com/" >adbdriver.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). You need to download and install platform tools (minimal ADB and fastboot) from <a class="link"   href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2317790" >http://forum.xda-developers.com/... <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Now open the folder where you’ve installed the above tools. By default, it is in the Local disc <em>C\windows\system32\platform_tools</em> location. However, you might want to locate them by searching on the windows search engine. You have to hold the Shift key and right-click inside the folder to click on”Open Command Window Here.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329561742.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 4: Test the ADB</p><p>Here, we would like to test whether the ABD is working properly. To do this, connect your phone to the PC using a USB. In the command prompt, type <strong>adb services</strong> and then press enter. If it’s working properly, you should see a device on this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329984622.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 5: Find the Android wifi password.</p><p>Now, it is time to type the given command in the command prompt and type: <em>adb pull &#x2F;data&#x2F;misc&#x2F;wifi&#x2F;wpa_supplicant.conf c:&#x2F;wpa_supplicant.conf</em>. This will fetch the file from your phone to the local disc C drive of the PC.</p><p>Step 6: Get the wifi passwords.</p><p>Lastly, open the file with a notepad, and there you go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556331232772.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Now you learned how to show the wifi password on your Android device.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/unlock-your-vivo-y200e-5gs-potential-the-top-20-lock-screen-apps-you-need-to-try-by-drfone-android/"><u>Unlock Your Vivo Y200e 5Gs Potential The Top 20 Lock Screen Apps You Need to Try</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-forgotten-the-voicemail-password-of-xiaomi-mix-fold-3-try-these-fixes-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Forgotten The Voicemail Password Of Xiaomi Mix Fold 3?

Among all the tricks of how to reset a Honor Magic V2  phone that is locked, it only works if you are running around version 4.4 KitKat or older than that. Neither less to say, in order for the step to work properly, you need your Gmail account to be properly configured with the Honor Magic V2 device.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Attempt Passwords</strong></p><p>At first, you need to make five attempts to unlock your device. Whether you have used a PIN or Pattern lock, Android will always give you five attempts to get the password right. Once you get that, it will trigger the “Forget Password&#x2F;Pattern” option on Your Honor Magic V2. This way, you can sneak back into the system once again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/12/reset-a-motorola-phone-that-is-locked-6.jpg"                      alt="reset a motorola phone that is locked 6"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Enter Credentials</strong></p><p>Once you hit the option, you will be redirected to another page, where you need to enter your Gmail id and password.

However, pattern locks are easy to crack, and today, we bring you all you want to know about pattern locks and how to create a <strong>hard pattern lock</strong>. Further to this, we also tell you how to move beyond pattern locks and what to do in case you forgot the hard pattern lock you just set and are unable to unlock your smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="creating more secure pattern locks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks"></a>Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks</h2><p>Pattern lock is an Android-only feature that makes it easy for users to have a modicum of security on their smartphones. Most users do not prefer using and remembering a PIN to unlock the smartphone. Creating a pattern makes it easier, somehow.</p><p>There is a 9-point grid on which you swipe your finger from point to point, in any direction, and when you take your finger off, that pattern you swiped becomes the key to unlock your smartphone.</p><p>Pattern locks were exceedingly common only a few years ago, and they are not recommended for use any longer due to concerns (mentioned later in the article).</p><h3 id="1-1-Popularity-and-Usage"><a href="#1-1-Popularity-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="1.1: Popularity and Usage"></a>1.1: Popularity and Usage</h3><p>Old habits die hard, or so they say, right? That’s because it is true. We are creatures of habit, and pattern locks have been around for a long, long time. We are accustomed to pattern locks. So, even with even easier technologies such as fingerprint recognition and face recognition, we tend to gravitate towards the familiar old pattern lock.</p><p>The only thing is, there is a reason why pattern locks are no longer the preferred option to use for unlocking your smartphones. As it happens, that reason is security, and it can be very easy for humans to take a swipe (pardon the pun) at your pattern lock. And guess what? The research conducted suggests that they would get it right with an unsettling accuracy.</p><h3 id="1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>With on-the-go lifestyles, our smartphones have become indispensable and contain some of the most sensitive aspects of our lives – IDs, credit and debit cards in digital wallets, photo and video memories, business documents – you name it, the smartphones have it, on the go. This has opened our lives up to the public at large, and if someone steals our smartphone or, best case, finds it, the only barrier preventing them from being privy to all that wealth of our sensitive information is that screen lock – the pattern lock that we set on our smartphones. That’s it – the single pattern lock stands between malicious actors and our data. You might be beginning to realize just how crazy this is.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There are two advantages to using pattern locks. One, they are better than nothing. Two, they are easy to use. And that’s about it. There is no third advantage to pattern locks. We might think we set a hard pattern lock that nobody could guess, but, as research proves, we might be thinking too low of human prowess.</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>Security, or rather, the lack of it, is the lone disadvantage of using a pattern lock. What good is a pattern lock that can be easily deciphered? Sure, they are easy to use, and they are better than not having anything, but would you really want to protect your life’s data with something that could be, as researchers found out, breached in under 5 attempts? We don’t think you do!</p><p>The research found that 64% of test subjects who were shown videos of people unlocking their phones could correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock, that too after viewing the video only once! That number shot up to 80% if they were allowed to see the video again. That is simply astounding and a nightmare for security. When it comes to PINs, only 11% could guess a 6-digit PIN after viewing the unlocking video once, and that number shot up to 27% when they could see the video two times.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)"></a>Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)</h2><p>Now, if you must continue using a pattern lock, let’s help you know how to create a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy to decipher as easy pattern locks. For that, you should know how people use pattern locks, the kind of pattern locks they create, and the ones that are the most commonly used pattern locks. That way, you can avoid those fallacies and create a hard pattern lock for your smartphone.</p><h3 id="2-1-The-Pattern-Locks-People-Use-Most-Commonly"><a href="#2-1-The-Pattern-Locks-People-Use-Most-Commonly" class="headerlink" title="2.1: The Pattern Locks People Use Most Commonly"></a>2.1: The Pattern Locks People Use Most Commonly</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-2.jpg"                      alt="common pattern locks"                ></p><p>Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, gave a presentation on pattern locks at DEFCON 23 and made a bold claim. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.”</p><p>She presented the following statistics to support her claim:</p><ul><li>- In her research, she found that 77% of people started with one of the 4 corners when creating a pattern lock.</li><li>- 44% of people started with the top-left dot and 15% with the top-right, while the bottom-left was preferred by 14% of her test subjects.</li><li>- People set 5-point pattern locks on average, and most users were content with a 4-point pattern.</li></ul><p>These are some of the most common pattern locks people create:</p><ul><li>- patterns in the shapes of alphabets,</li><li>- patterns in the shapes of numerals,</li><li>- patterns in any other simple shape, such as square, triangle, star, etc.</li></ul><p>To understand how this is a security nightmare, the possible combinations for a 4-point pattern are a measly 1624, whereas by adding just 1 more point to the pattern and creating a 5-point pattern, the number of possible combinations becomes 7152, an increase of 5528 combinations. In stark contrast, creating a 9-point pattern would give you over 140,000 possible combinations!</p><h3 id="2-2-How-to-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock"><a href="#2-2-How-to-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock" class="headerlink" title="2.2: How to Create a Hard Pattern Lock"></a>2.2: How to Create a Hard Pattern Lock</h3><p>Knowing what most people do when creating a pattern lock, it becomes easy to avoid those mistakes and instead create a hard pattern lock for oneself.</p><ul><li>- Do not start creating a pattern lock from any of the 4 corners of the grid.</li><li>- Never use your first initial as your pattern lock.</li><li>- Never use the shape of a numeral as your pattern lock.</li><li>- Use all 9 points on the grid to create your pattern lock, and contrary to popular belief, you can go over the connecting lines several times, creating a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy for people to decipher!</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Going-Beyond-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-3-Going-Beyond-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Going Beyond Pattern Locks"></a>Part 3: Going Beyond Pattern Locks</h2><p>You might think that now that you have set a hard pattern lock, you are good to go.

Using fingerprint recognition requires you to set a 6-digit PIN and then set a fingerprint to unlock your device. You can set additional fingerprints, too.</p><p>This way, your device is the most secure it can be today.

It links the Honor Magic V2 device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.</p><p>While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like <strong>RootJunky</strong> can help you <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html"><u>bypass FRP Lock</u></a>.
