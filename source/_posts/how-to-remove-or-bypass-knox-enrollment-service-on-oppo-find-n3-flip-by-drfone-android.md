## Part 1: What Is the Knox Enrollment Service?

**Knox Enrollment Service** is an integral part of Samsung’s Knox, a toolbox of security features for enterprise-level management of mobile devices. This service is pivotal in how companies manage and secure their mobile devices, especially in a corporate environment.

### What It Is

**Knox Enrollment Service by Samsung** is a tool businesses use to automatically enroll Samsung devices into their management systems when the Oppo Find N3 Flip device is connected to the internet. It’s designed for IT administrators to easily deploy, manage, and enforce policies across devices in their network, ensuring consistency and security.

### What It Does

The service allows IT administrators to pre-configure settings and apps and manage other aspects of the Oppo Find N3 Flip device’s functionality. When a device is enrolled, it can be remotely controlled and monitored. The administrators can push updates, track device locations, remotely wipe data for security, and enforce specific compliance policies. This automation of device enrollment simplifies the setup process for both the IT department and the end-user.

### Advantages

Of course, Samsung Knox would not be popular without any advantages. Here are some of them:

- **Enhanced security.** Knox Enrollment Service ensures corporate devices have robust security features. This helps in safeguarding sensitive data against unauthorized access.
- **Streamlined management.**It simplifies the Oppo Find N3 Flip device management, allowing administrators to configure devices without physical access.
- The service enables the customization of devices to fit specific business needs, including installing necessary applications and restrictions on unauthorized apps.
- **Compliance Assurance.** With the ability to have policies remotely, companies can ensure that all devices comply with corporate standards and regulations.

### Disadvantages

**Knox Enrollment Service** is a powerful tool for enterprise mobile management, offering enhanced security and simplified device management. However, it also introduces challenges, particularly regarding user autonomy and privacy. Understanding these advantages and disadvantages is crucial before removing or bypassing this service.

## Part 2: How To Remove Knox Enrollment Service on Your Oppo Find N3 Flip

In most cases, an administrator can only effectively **remove the Knox Enrollment Service** through the Samsung Knox Portal. This typically requires cooperation from your employer.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to removing itfrom the Admin’s Portal:

- **Step 1:** Sign in to the Samsung Knox Portal using administrative credentials.
- **Step 2:** Navigate to **Samsung Knox Mobile Enrollment**, then click **Devices.**
- **Step 3:** Select the Oppo Find N3 Flip device in question and click **Actions.**
- **Step 4:** Choose the **Clear Profile** option to remove all profiles from the Oppo Find N3 Flip device. This action will disassociate the Oppo Find N3 Flip device from any existing Knox configurations.

![knox unenroll confirmation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-knox-enrollment-service-03.jpg)

After removing the Oppo Find N3 Flip device from Knox Enrollment via the admin account, you may still need to uninstall the Knox app from the Android device. This can usually be done through the Oppo Find N3 Flip device’s settings. Navigate to ‘Apps’ in the settings menu, locate the Knox app, and select ‘Uninstall’ or ‘Disable’. Be aware that this option might not be available on all devices, depending on how Knox was configured.

### Rooting and Flashing a New ROM To Remove Knox Enrollment Service

For the more tech-savvy users, another method to **bypass Knox Enrollment Service** is by rooting the Oppo Find N3 Flip device and flashing a new ROM. This process involves gaining root access to the Oppo Find N3 Flip device’s operating system, which allows you to modify the software extensively. After rooting, you can flash a new ROM that doesn’t include the Knox software.

However, this method is risky and not recommended for the average user. It will void your warranty and potentially ‘brick’ your device, rendering it unusable. Furthermore, this action could notify your employer of your attempt to remove Knox, which could have professional repercussions. Proceed with this method only if you know the risks and consequences.

**Removing Knox Enrollment Service** from your phone is feasible but requires careful consideration, especially in a corporate context. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions and understand the risks of modifying your device’s software.

Gently wipe the fingerprint sensor area using a clean, dry cloth to ensure thorough cleaning. For better results, consider using a dampened cotton swab with water or isopropyl alcohol. Before using it again, ensure the sensor is entirely dry.

##### 3\. Compressed Air or Soft Brush

Use compressed air or a soft brush if there's visible debris or particles around the sensor. Be cautious not to apply excessive pressure that might damage the sensor.

### 5\. Screen Protector: Dirty or Damaged

#### Problem

A smudged or impaired screen protector might disrupt the working of the fingerprint sensor. This can potentially cause it to fail to recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Clean the Screen Protector

Start by effectively cleaning the screen protector on your Pixel device. For a thorough cleaning, consider utilizing a screen cleaning solution. Ensure that the screen protector is free from any dirt or debris.

##### 2\. Replace Damaged Protectors

Is the screen protector visibly damaged, scratched, or peeling off? If yes, consider replacing it with a new one. Damaged protectors can hinder fingerprint recognition and compromise device protection.

##### 3\. Check Compatibility

Ensure the screen protector is designed to be compatible with fingerprint sensors. Some protectors may obstruct or interfere with the sensor's functionality.

##### 4\. Remove Air Bubbles

There can be air bubbles trapped under the screen protector. If there are, gently press them out towards the edges using a card designed for this purpose.

![protector screen dirty or damaged](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-9.jpg)

### 6\. Clean Your Finger

#### Problem

The problem may lie with your fingers rather than the Oppo Find N3 Flip device. Unclean or moist fingers can hinder accurate fingerprint recognition on the sensor, causing **the Oppo Find N3 Flip fingerprint sensor to not work**.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleanse and Dry Your Hands

Remove any dirt, oil, or moisture that might cause issues with the fingerprint sensor. It's crucial to wash and thoroughly dry your hands. Additionally, verify that your fingers are entirely dry before engaging the sensor. The reason is any moisture or dampness may cause inaccuracies in fingerprint identification.

##### 2\. Avoid Oily or Greasy Substances

Refrain from touching oily or greasy surfaces before using the fingerprint sensor. These substances can transfer onto your fingers, affecting sensor accuracy. If your fingers are dirty or damp, pause to clean them using a dry, clean cloth.

![cleaning finger to use fingerprint](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-10.jpg)

### 7\. Covering Screen if Fingerprint on Screen

#### Problem

Fingerprint marks or smudges on the screen might disrupt sensor functionality. This leads to inaccurate recognition when you try to unlock your device.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Avoid Covering the Sensor Area

Be cautious while cleaning the screen to avoid covering or smudging the area around the fingerprint sensor. Precise cleaning around this area prevents interference with sensor functionality.

##### 2\. Use Proper Holding Technique

While holding the Oppo Find N3 Flip device, avoid placing your fingers or palms over the fingerprint sensor. Opt for holding the Oppo Find N3 Flip device to minimize accidental contact with the sensor area.

![hold phone properly](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-11.jpg)

### 8\. Fingerprint Sensor Not Visible

#### Problem

Misconfigured settings on your Pixel device can lead to situations where the fingerprint sensor is not visible. It can lead to scenarios where the Oppo Find N3 Flip device fails to recognize your screen unlocking attempt.

#### Solution: Adjust the Setting To Consistently Display the Sensor

You must adjust the display settings to ensure the fingerprint sensor is always visible. To do that, you can begin by opening the Settings app. Navigate to the "Display" tab and select "Lock Screen." On the following window, toggle on "Always show time and info."

![put sensor to always display](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-12.jpg)

### 9\. Low Touch Sensitivity

#### Problem

The fingerprint sensor may have [low touch sensitivity](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/google-pixel-4a-touch-screen-not-working.html). It can lead to difficulties in accurately recognizing fingerprints, leading to **Oppo Find N3 Flip fingerprint not working**.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Adjust Sensitivity Settings

Accessories like a screen protector might impact the performance of your Pixel device's touch sensitivity. When using a screen protector, your Pixel enhances touch sensitivity. To do that, navigate to the Settings app and open it. Move to the "Display" window and scroll down to the last option. Toggle on the "Screen protector mode" to increase the screen sensitivity.

![turn on screen protector mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-13.jpg)

##### 2\. Finger Re-Enrollment

Delete existing fingerprints and re-register them. This re-enrollment can sometimes improve sensitivity and help remove the issues. Here is how you can delete and re-enroll your fingerprint:

- **Step 1.** In the Settings app of your Pixel, tap "Security & Privacy." Then, press "Device Unlock" and choose "Fingerprint Unlock." The device will now ask you to provide your device PIN or password.

![navigate to security settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-14.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Tap "Fingerprint Unlock" on the following screen and delete the previously enrolled fingerprints. Then, press "Add fingerprint" and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the process.

![add new fingerprint](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-15.jpg)

### 10\. Other Hardware Issues

#### Problem

Persistent fingerprint sensor problems might indicate underlying [hardware issues](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/best-apps-for-android-hardware-test.html). This could go beyond common troubleshooting and might require professional help.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Inspect for Physical Damage

Thoroughly examine your Pixel device for any physical damage. These include cracks, dents, or scratches around the fingerprint sensor area. Physical damage could affect the sensor's functionality.

##### 2\. Safe Mode Check

Boot the Oppo Find N3 Flip device in safe mode to determine if third-party apps are causing conflicts. To do that, press the "Power" key with any volume key to access the power menu. Afterward, long-press the "Power Off" option until the "Reboot to Safe Mode" option appears on your device's screen. Press "OK" to reboot into Safe Mode and test the fingerprint sensor's functionality.

![reboot google pixel to safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-16.jpg)

##### 3\. Professional Assessment

If you suspect hardware issues, seek professional help from authorized service centers. A clear sign of hardware issues can be visible damage or the sensor failing to function even in safe mode.

### 11\. Factory Reset as Last Resort

#### Problem

Did all other troubleshooting methods fail to resolve persistent fingerprint sensor issues? Then, a [factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/android-factory-reset-code.html) might be required to revert the Oppo Find N3 Flip device to its original settings.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Backup Data

Before initiating a factory reset, ensure that all crucial data is safeguarded. This encompasses contacts, photos, documents, and any other significant files. Use Google's backup services or third-party apps to securely [back up your data](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/).

##### 2\. Initiating Factory Reset

Proceed with the following steps to execute a factory reset on your Pixel device:

- **Step 1.** On your Pixel smartphone, navigate to Settings and access the "System" tab. Here, scroll down to the bottom and tap "Reset Options."

![head to system settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-17.jpg)
