Step 7: In the command prompt window, type “fastboot devices” and press enter. Xiaomi 14  will show up in the command prompt.

Note: The drivers have to be installed correctly to see the Xiaomi 14 device in the command prompt. So, if the Xiaomi 14 device does not show up, reinstall HTC Sync Manager and try again after restarting the computer.

Step 8: On HTC Dev’s website third page, click on “proceed to Step 9”. Follow the steps listed and then click on submit. The unlock token code for the Xiaomi 14 device will be mailed by HTC. Download the token and name it “Unlock\_code.bin” and place the token in the fastboot folder.

Step 9: Now, in the command prompt window, type the following:

fastboot flash unlocktoken Unlock\_code.bin

Step 10: On the Xiaomi 14 , one message will appear asking if you want to unlock the Xiaomi 14 device bootloader.

Use volume keys to select and power button to confirm. Once this is done, the Xiaomi 14  device will restart once and it’s done. The device is now bootloader unlocked.
