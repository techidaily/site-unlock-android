However, the process may seem a bit time-consuming to you. Here is how you can do it.

### Way 2: Boot into Safe Mode to Bypass Third-Party App Screen Lock

Type the new password once, then confirm it by typing it again. This will change the password in a few minutes and the new password can be used to unlock the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device.

### Way 5: Use Forgot Pattern Feature \[Android 4.4 Version and Earlier\]

After a few failed attempts, the warning "Try again in 30 seconds" appears and here is where the steps begin. Let us get to know in detail.
