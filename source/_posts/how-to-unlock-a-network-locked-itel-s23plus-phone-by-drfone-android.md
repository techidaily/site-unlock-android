## How to Unlock a Network Locked Itel S23+ Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Itel S23+ phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Itel S23+ device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Itel S23+ network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Itel S23+ Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Itel S23+ phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased.
