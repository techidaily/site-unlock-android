Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Vivo Y28 5G  with Find My Device.

Here are the steps for **Vivo Y28 5G  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Vivo Y28 5G  with the power button.
