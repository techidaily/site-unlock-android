## How to Unlock a Network Locked Infinix Smart 8 HD Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Infinix Smart 8 HD phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Infinix Smart 8 HD device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Infinix Smart 8 HD network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Infinix Smart 8 HD Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Infinix Smart 8 HD phone means that your device has become carrier-specific.

Having a network-locked Infinix Smart 8 HD phone poses undesired connectivity issues.

### 1\. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?

### 2\. Is it legal to unlock it?

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.
