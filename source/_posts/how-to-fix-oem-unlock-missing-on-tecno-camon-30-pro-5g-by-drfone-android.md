## How To Fix OEM Unlock Missing on Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G?

Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Unlock is a function on Android devices. It allows you to unlock your phone bootloader. A bootloader or bootstrap loader gathers the operating system files, loads them into memory, and hands over control, essentially starting your device. Unlocking the bootloader assists you in installing custom ROMs, flashing custom kernels, and rooting your phone.

However, this freedom comes with some trade-offs. Most manufacturers will void your warranty if you unlock the bootloader, and it can also make your phone face higher risks of malware and other security threats. Additionally, it can be difficult to relock the bootloader once you unlock it.

If you encounter the **OEM unlock missing** on your Android phone despite wanting to unlock your bootloader, this article can help. You will learn the step-by-step guide for the different methods to fix the **missing OEM unlock** option. Before diving into solutions, let's explore why this option might be unavailable in the first place.

![using a phone at work](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?

Finding that OEM Unlock is missing on your Android phones can be frustrating, particularly if you plan to modify your software or install a custom ROM. But don't worry. There are several possible explanations for this. Let's explore some of the most common reasons:

Manufacturer Restrictions

The **Missing OEM Unlock** option can often be due to restrictions imposed by your device's manufacturers. They may intentionally remove this option to safeguard device security and compatibility. It is common with carrier-locked devices. As a result, the OEM Unlock option may not show.

Bootloader Already Unlocked

In some cases, the **Android OEM Unlock Missing** issue arises [<u>when the bootloader has already been unlocked</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-unlock-xiaomi-bootloader.html). Relocking the bootloader might make the option reappear. But exercise caution as this process can erase device data.

![oem unlock option greyed out](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-02.jpg)

Developer Options Not Enabled

It might seem obvious, but sometimes the simplest things get overlooked. The OEM Unlock option can only be accessed from within Developer Options. If this menu isn't enabled, you won't see it.

Carrier-Locked Devices

The **OEM Unlock Missing** issue can also occur if your device is [<u>carrier-locked</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/carrier-unlock-android-phone.html). Carriers often impose restrictions to prevent users from switching networks, and bootloader unlocking is one way to do that. Unfortunately, the **missing OEM Unlock** option is usually intentional, and unlocking your device can be more complicated.

Security Features

Enhanced security features, like Samsung's KNOX, can sometimes conceal the OEM Unlock option. Temporarily turning off these features might show the option, but it's crucial to be aware of the potential security implications of doing so.

Corrupted Bootloader

A corrupted bootloader can also lead to the **Android OEM Unlock missing** problem. The bootloader plays a role in the boot process, and if it's damaged, it might not display the necessary options. This can be caused by software glitches, failed flashing attempts, or even [<u>hardware issues</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-run-a-hardware-test-on-xiaomi.html). In this scenario, you might need to consult your device's manufacturer or a technical specialist to help repair or re-flash the bootloader.

Connectivity Issues

A poor connection between your device and computer can also prevent the OEM Unlocking from showing up. Check your cables and try using different USB ports to ensure a stable connection.

## Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?

Unlocking your phone's bootloader (OEM Unlock) varies across models and brands. Some need a passcode or PIN after rebooting the phone, while others don't. Even if your phone doesn't require a separate password, your existing screen lock (password, PIN, pattern) will usually be needed to enable the **missing OEM unlock** option.

But what if you forgot that, too? [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) - Screen Unlock can help bypass forgotten passwords and unlock your phone even if you don't have the technical knowledge.

Now that you've regained access to your device thanks to Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock, you can move forward with enabling the **OEM unlock missing** option. Next up, we'll guide you through the steps in several ways. Let's start with the Developer options.

## Part 3: How To Enable OEM Unlock Missing From the Developer Options?

Developer Options, a hidden menu in Android, offers advanced features like app debugging and custom ROM installation. But if the Android OEM unlock option is missing, you can't unlock your device's bootloader. Below is a step-by-step guide for you so the **OEM unlock missing** option will show in the Developer Options. Remember, this process may erase your device data, so a complete backup is essential before proceeding.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app on your Android phone.
- **Step 2:** Navigate to **About Phone** at the bottom of the list, then tap **Software information**.

![software information settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-08.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Tap on the **Build number** repeatedly (7 times) until you see a message saying, "**You are now a developer!**" or similar.
- **Step 4:** Go back to **Settings** \> **System** and find the **Developer options** menu.
- **Step 5:** Scroll down and tap the toggle switch next to **Enable OEM Unlock** to turn it on.

![enable oem unlock developer option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-09.jpg)

- **Step 6:** A warning message explaining the risks of turning on the OEM unlock will appear. Read it carefully and tap **Enable** if you want to proceed.

![turn on oem unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-10.jpg)

- **Step 7:** Enter your PIN or password to confirm the unlock when prompted
- **Step 8:** Your device will reboot, and OEM Unlocking will be enabled.

## Part 4: How To Fix OEM Unlock Missing by Adjusting Date and Time?

Some manufacturers intentionally delay the availability of the OEM unlock after a software update for security reasons. Changing the date to a past date before the update rolled out can trick the system into displaying the option, as it thinks the update hasn't happened yet. It is a temporary fix, and the option will likely disappear again later when the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G device automatically syncs the correct date.

If you intend to try this method, follow these steps to **enable OEM unlock missing** or greyed out after an Android update:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app.
- **Step 2:** Go to **System** or **General management**, depending on your Android version.
- **Step 3:** Tap on **Date and Time**.
- **Step 4:** Turn off **Automatic date and time**.

![turn off automatic date and time](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-11.jpg)

- **Step 5:** Tap on **Set date** and choose the desired older date from the calendar.
- **Step 6:** Tap on **Set time** and choose the desired time from the clock.
- **Step 7:** Tap on **Done** to save the changes.
- **Step 8:** Go back to the **Developers options** and turn off the **Auto update system** option.

![turn off auto update system](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-12.jpg)

- **Step 9:** Go to **Settings** > **Software update**, then turn off **Auto download over Wi-Fi**.

![turn off auto download over wi-fi](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-13.jpg)

This method should **enable the OEM unlock missing** issue. Otherwise, proceed to the next section for another solution.

## Part 5: How To Fix OEM Unlock Missing by Removing SIM Card?

Certain carriers restrict bootloader unlocking on their devices to ensure compatibility and prevent unauthorized modifications. For these phones, unlocking the SIM card becomes crucial before you can toggle the OEM unlock option. Here are the steps to fix the **OEM Unlock missing** or greyed out using SIM card removal:

- **Step 1:** Use the SIM ejector tool (often included with your phone) or a small pin to push the tray out.
- **Step 2:** Go to **Settings** > **General Management** > **Reset**, then select **Factory data reset**. Enter your PIN or password if needed.

![android factory data reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-14.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Review the warning and tap **Reset** to confirm.
- **Step 4:** Once the reset is complete, your phone will restart. Connect to Wi-Fi when prompted.
- **Step 5:** Skip any prompts to log in to your Google or email account. Then, repeat the process to open the **Developer Options** in the previous sections.

Having the **OEM Unlock missing** or greyed out can leave Android users feeling locked out of customization possibilities. Fortunately, this article has outlined helpful solutions like enabling the **Android OEM Unlock missing** option via the Developer Options. You can also try other methods above, like adjusting date and time settings or even a sim card removal trick.

For devices running Android 11, **changing the lock screen clock** is still available. In some instances, you can even customize its style by following these simple steps:

- **Step 1**: For users with Android 11 or older, go to **Settings** > **Lock screen & security**. Depending on your phone model, tap **Lock screen** or **Security**.

![customizing android lock screen clock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-lock-screen-clock-02.jpg)

- **Step 2: G**o to **Customize Lock screen** > **Clock**. Next, customize or activate the lock screen clock.

**Note**

The exact names of settings may change depending on the manufacturer and version of Android. But the navigation should be similar.

## Part 2. How To Change Lock Screen Clock on Android \[5 Methods\]

Currently, there isn’t an official method to **change the lock screen clock on Android** 12. However, there are several workarounds you can do. Let’s explore these techniques and see which works best for you.

### Method 1: Change Your Wallpaper

In Android 11, adjusting your wallpaper is accessible through the Android Settings menu.

- **Step 1A:** Navigate to the “All Apps” screen and select **Settings**. For Samsung Galaxy devices on Android 11, access the **Wallpaper** option within the settings menu.

![wallpaper settings on android 11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-lock-screen-clock-03.jpg)

In Android 12, the process remains consistent.

- **Step 1:** Locate the **Wallpaper & style** button within the **Settings** menu**.**

![wallpaper settings on android 12](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-lock-screen-clock-04.jpg)

- **Step 2**: Follow the provided instructions to transform your lock screen experience. Replace the oversized clock with dynamic, changing wallpapers.

### Method 2: Turn Off the Always-On Display

An alternative to avoid **the Android lock screen clock** is disabling the Always-on Display (AOD).

- **Step 1**: Access the **Settings** menu on your Android device. Scroll down and choose **Lock** **screen** > **Always On Display**.

![android always on display setting](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-lock-screen-clock-05.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Toggle off to deactivate the **Always On Display**.

**_**_Note_**_**

**While this won’t alter the lock screen clock itself, it will turn off the display. It will prevent the constant presence of the lock screen clock. Instead, the clock will only become visible when you press the power button.**

### Method 3: Disable the Double-Line Clock

Originally, there was no provision to **change the lock screen clock in Android 12**. With the release of a new update, Google introduced an option to deactivate the clock, bringing relief to users. Follow the steps below to disable the double-line clock on your Android.

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings** > **Display**. Next, choose **Lock screen**.

![double line clock android settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-lock-screen-clock-06.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Toggle the **Double-line clock** off.

**_**_Note_**_**

**If you want to display a digital or analog clock, open the** **_**_Clock_**_** **app. Tap the** **_**_three dots_**_** **>** **_**_Settings_**_** **>** **_**_Style_**_****.**

### Method 4: Turn On Screensaver

An alternative method to modify the **Android lock screen clock** involves activating Android’s screen saver. There are options where it’s more pleasing than the default lock screen clock. If you want to **change the lock screen clock**, follow the steps.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Clock** app and tap the **three dots** in the upper-right corner. Select **Screensaver** and toggle it on.

![screensaver and new lock screen clock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-lock-screen-clock-07.jpg)

- **Step 2**: If you want to customize the screensaver clock’s appearance, go to **Settings** > **Display** > **Screensaver.** Choose analog, digital, or night mode.

### Method 5: Keep Unread Notifications

To avoid adjusting your Android device settings, you can make the lock screen clock smaller by maintaining unread notifications. The clock occupies less space when there are unread notifications. It shifts back to the top-left corner when you receive a new notification. Simply leave notifications unread to keep the clock smaller.

![unread notifications on android lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-lock-screen-clock-08.jpg)

### Bonus

For users who prefer not to have a lock screen clock, follow these steps:

- **Step 1**: Open **Settings** > **Lock screen** or **Security & lock screen**.
- **Step 2**: Look for **Clock and FaceWidgets** or a similar option. Disable or toggle off the **Clock** or **Show clock** setting. Save changes, and your lock screen should no longer display the clock.

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings** > **Lock screen** or **Lock screen & security**. Choose **Customize lock screen** > **Clock**, **Clock** **style,** or **Lock screen clock**.

- **Step 2:** Choose between different styles, such as digital, analog, or others. Some Samsung models offer extra settings like color, size, and more to enhance your lock screen further. Select the one that suits your taste.

If you’d rather remove the lock screen clock on your Samsung device, follow these steps:

- **Step 1**: Go to **Settings** > **Lock screen** or **Lock screen & security**.Choose **Customize lock screen** > **Clock**, **Clock** **style,** or **Lock screen clock**.
