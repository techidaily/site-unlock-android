## Part 1: Ways That Itel Lets You Unlock Your Itel A60

Itel A60  are more than just smartphones; they are gateways to a personalized and secure user experience. To access the myriad of features these devices offer, Google provides several unlocking methods, ensuring both convenience and security. Here are these options:

Setting up a PIN is straightforward via the Itel A60 device’s security settings, and unlocking your phone is as easy as tapping in the correct sequence of numbers.
- Similar to a PIN but potentially more secure due to the allowance of a longer combination of numbers and letters. A passcode is ideal for those who seek an extra layer of security. You set it up in the security settings and use it to unlock your phone just like a PIN but with the added complexity of alphanumeric characters.
- **Face Unlock.Pixel’s Face Unlock** uses advanced facial recognition software. It scans your face to grant access, offering a hands-free and quick way to unlock your Pixel. This feature can be activated in the security settings and requires a simple glance at your phone to unlock.

![woman holding a Itel A60  ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/google-pixel-7-unlock-02.jpg)

- [**<u><b>Fingerprint Unlock</b></u>**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/google-pixel-frp-bypass.html)**.** This method uses your unique fingerprint as a key. It’s fast, secure, and convenient. The Pixel 6a, 6, and 7 fingerprint scanners are actually under the display. Register your fingerprint in the settings, then touch the sensor to gain access.
- **Pattern**. If you prefer a more visual method, the [<u>pattern lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mi-pattern-lock.html)lets you draw a specific shape or pattern on the screen to unlock your phone. It’s a fun and interactive way to secure your device. Create your pattern in the security settings, and unlock your phone by replicating it on the lock screen.

In essence, each unlocking method offered by the Itel A60  provides a blend of security and ease. Whichever unlocking method you prefer, Google ensures that accessing your phone is secure and convenient. All you need to do is set up your preferred method in the Itel A60 device’s settings and use it to unlock your phone.

- **Force resetting your device**. To force reset your Itel, press and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously to enter recovery mode. Use the volume buttons to navigate to **Wipe data/factory reset**and select it with the power button. This will get rid of existing password locks.
- **Flashing a new ROM**. This is more complex and typically requires downloading a new firmware and flashing tool. It’s only recommended for advanced users or as a last resort.

Always [<u>back up your data regularly</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup/android-backup-software.html), and use these methods responsibly, considering their potential to erase your data or affect your device’s warranty.

## Bonus: How To Perform a SIM Unlock on Itel

- **Step 2:** Call your carrier and request a SIM unlock code. You’ll likely need to provide your Itel’s IMEI number.
- **Step 3:** If you meet your carrier’s requirements, they will email you the SIM unlock code within 2-5 days.
- **Step 4:** Once you receive the code, replace your current SIM with one from a different carrier. When prompted, enter the SIM unlock code you received via email.

### Alternative Method: Android SIM Unlock

If your carrier cannot unlock your Itel A60  ’s SIM, or if you prefer a quicker solution, consider using network unlocking services. This may be websites like UnlockBase, Mobile Unlocks, etc.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Itel A60 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Itel A60 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Itel A60  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Itel A60 :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Itel A60  device.
