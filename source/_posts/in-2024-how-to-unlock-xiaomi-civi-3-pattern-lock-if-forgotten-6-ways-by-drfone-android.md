## How to Remove Operator Lock on Xiaomi Civi 3 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Xiaomi Civi 3 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Xiaomi Civi 3  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Xiaomi Civi 3 :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Xiaomi Civi 3  device.

## Bonus Tip: How to Unlock Bootloader?

Unlocking the bootloader on your Android device provides significant advantages. These actions encompass obtaining root access, installing custom ROMs, configuring custom recoveries, and carrying out advanced procedures. Here's an essential guide on unlocking the bootloader of your Sony device while keeping all precautions in mind:

**Step 1:** To start with the process, verify the bootloader status for your Sony smartphone. On opening the "Dialer" app, dial the number "\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*" and access the "Rooting Status" option within the "Service Provider" settings.

**Step 2:** If the bootloader status displays "Yes," ensure that the Sony USB drivers and ADB tools are installed on your computer. Enable "USB Debugging" and "OEM Unlocking" on your smartphone and switch it off.

**Step 3:** Connect the Xiaomi Civi 3  smartphone with a USB cable and press the "Power + Volume Up" keys for a few seconds. Open the Windows computer and access the "Devices and Printers" directory. Right-click on the "fastboot driver" file, select "Update," and select the location of the "android\_winbus.inf" file. Verify the fastboot connectivity through the CMD command.

**Step 4:** Open the official “Sony Unlocking Site” and add in the IMEI number. On acknowledging, use the commands as follows: `adb reboot bootloader`

Unlock the bootloader with the following command: `fastboot oem unlock 0x<insert your unlock code`

Verify the bootloader is unlocked and use the command to reboot the system; if not done automatically: `fastboot reboot`

## Conclusion

Forgetting your Xiaomi Civi 3  screen unlock password, PIN, or pattern is quite common. For such instances, there are several methods that you can use to unlock your screen, 5 of which we have discussed in this article.

If you’re looking for ways that are time-effective and reliable, you can use your Google account or other ways to unlock Xiaomi Civi 3  and set a new screen lock. However, with these methods, you can lose your data, so we only recommend using them if your device is backed up.
