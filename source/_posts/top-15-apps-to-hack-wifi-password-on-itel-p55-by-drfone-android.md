## Part 1: Lock System About Itel P55  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Itel P55  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Itel P55  is one of the older versions of Itel  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Itel P55  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Itel P55  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Itel P55  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?

You can easily remove the lock screen of your Itel P55  if you remember your password or pattern.

- Go to “Settings” and follow the previous steps to open the "Lockscreen Password" settings.
- Disable the lock screen by tapping on the "Enable Lock Screen" button once.

## Part 2: 5 Solutions to Unlock Itel P55  Without Password or Pattern

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Itel P55  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Itel P55  with Find My Device.

Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Itel  device using your Google Account.

![Itel P55  lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-02.jpg)

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Itel P55  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Itel P55  with the power button.
