## Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the 'Forgot Pattern' feature?

One of the easiest and fastest ways to fix the forgot pattern lock issue on a device is by using its inbuilt “Forgot Pattern” feature. If you are using an Android 4.4 or earlier version, then you can simply access this feature. Since users can hack an Android device just by knowing the Google credentials of the connected device, the solution was later discontinued (as it was considered a security vulnerability). Nevertheless, if your device hasn’t been updated and you are using an Android 4.4 or previous version, then you can bypass the forgot pattern lock by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.

**Step 2.** On the same prompt, you can see an option of “Forgot pattern” on the bottom. Simply tap on it.

- Step 2. Insert the card on your device
- Step 3. Restart your device into recovery mode.
- Step 4. Flash the file on your card and restart the phone.
- Step 5. Now your phone would boot up without lock screen. Don't worry if you had a gesture lock or password. All you need to do is to input a random gesture or password, and it will be unlocked.

## Method 5. Delete the Password File Using ADB

It is yet another option that will work only when you have enabled USB Debugging previously on your device, and your PC is allowed to connect via ADB. If you meet such requirements, it is ideal to use this method to unlock the Vivo lock screen.

- Step 1. Connect your device to the PC using USB cable and open command prompt in the adb directory. Type the command "adb shell rm /data/system/gesture.key" and then press "Enter".
- Step 2. Restart your phone, and a secure lock screen must be gone, and you can access your device. Be sure to set a new PIN, pattern, or password before rebooting again.

## Method 6. Factory Reset to Bypass Vivo Lock Screen

A factory reset is the best option in almost any case if one of these solutions couldn't work. According to your device type, the process may vary. In most devices, you have to turn off the Vivo S18e device completely to start the process. But this method will delete all the precious data on the Vivo S18e device after the factory reset.

- Step 1. Hold the power button and volume down at the same time. It will open the Bootloader menu.
- Step 2. Press the volume down button two times to choose "Recovery Mode" and select it by pressing the "Power" button.
- Step 3. Hold down the power button and tap "Volume Up" once, and you would enter "recovery" mode.
- Step 4. Choose "Wipe Data/Factory Reset" option by using volume buttons.
- Step 5. Select it by pressing the Power button.
- Step 6. Select "Reboot System Now" once the process is done.

[Backup your Vivo phone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/samsung/samsung-backup.html) regularly in case of any data loss in the future.

## Method 7. Boot into Safe Mode

Chances may be that you are using a third-party lock screen app. Then lucky for you, this way works best to bypass the Vivo lock screen. Specifically, you can boot your Vivo device into [Android Safe Mode](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/safe-mode-in-android.html).

- Step 1. Open up the Power menu from the lock screen and press and hold the "Power Off" option.
- Step 2. It will ask if you want to boot in safe mode. Tap "OK"
- Step 3. Once the process finishes, it will temporarily disable the lock screen activated by the third-party app.
- Step 4. Uninstall the third-party lock screen or just reset the data.
- Step 5. Reboot your device and get out of safe mode.
- Step 6. Now the irritating lock screen app is removed completely.

## Method 8. Other Methods

- Step 1. Take your friend's phone to call on your locked phone.
- Step 2. Accept the call and press the back button without disconnecting.
- Step 3. Now you can access the Vivo S18e device completely
- Step 4. Go to the security settings of the Vivo S18e device and remove the pattern or pin.
- Step 5. It will ask you the correct pin that you don't know, guess, and try various combinations you can recall.

To avoid forgetting your password or PIN next time, be sure to write the pattern or numbers on a text file or paper to keep them safe. If you have to bypass the Vivo lock screen pattern, PIN, password, and fingerprint, you may consider using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).
