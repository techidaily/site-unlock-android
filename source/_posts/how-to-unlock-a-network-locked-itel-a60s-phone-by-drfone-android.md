## How to Unlock a Network Locked Itel A60s Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Itel A60s phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Itel A60s device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Itel A60s network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Itel A60s Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Itel A60s phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased.

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.
