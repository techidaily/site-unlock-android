#### Solution: Restart Your Pixel Device

One of the easiest and simplest solutions is to restart your Pixel phone. You can do that by pressing the "Power" and the "Volume Up" keys. It will lead to a pop-up power menu where you must choose "Restart" to reboot your device.

![restart google pixel device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-6.jpg)

### 4\. Dirty Phone or Sensor

#### Problem

Accumulated dirt, dust, or residue on the phone or fingerprint sensor can cause obstruction. This can lead to the failure to properly recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone

Employ a gentle, dry microfiber cloth for wiping down the complete surface of your Pixel device. Take particular care to thoroughly clean the region surrounding the fingerprint sensor. Refrain from utilizing rough substances or strong chemicals as they could potentially cause harm to the Tecno Spark 20 device.

![dirty sensor or phone issue](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-8.jpg)

### 5\. Screen Protector: Dirty or Damaged

#### Problem

A smudged or impaired screen protector might disrupt the working of the fingerprint sensor. This can potentially cause it to fail to recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Clean the Screen Protector

Start by effectively cleaning the screen protector on your Pixel device. For a thorough cleaning, consider utilizing a screen cleaning solution. Ensure that the screen protector is free from any dirt or debris.

##### 2\. Replace Damaged Protectors

Is the screen protector visibly damaged, scratched, or peeling off? If yes, consider replacing it with a new one. Damaged protectors can hinder fingerprint recognition and compromise device protection.

##### 3\. Check Compatibility

Ensure the screen protector is designed to be compatible with fingerprint sensors. Some protectors may obstruct or interfere with the sensor's functionality.

Misconfigured settings on your Pixel device can lead to situations where the fingerprint sensor is not visible. It can lead to scenarios where the Tecno Spark 20 device fails to recognize your screen unlocking attempt.

#### Solution: Adjust the Setting To Consistently Display the Sensor

You must adjust the display settings to ensure the fingerprint sensor is always visible. To do that, you can begin by opening the Settings app. Navigate to the "Display" tab and select "Lock Screen." On the following window, toggle on "Always show time and info."

### 9\. Low Touch Sensitivity

#### Problem

The fingerprint sensor may have [low touch sensitivity](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/google-pixel-4a-touch-screen-not-working.html). It can lead to difficulties in accurately recognizing fingerprints, leading to **Tecno Spark 20 fingerprint not working**.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Adjust Sensitivity Settings

Accessories like a screen protector might impact the performance of your Pixel device's touch sensitivity. When using a screen protector, your Pixel enhances touch sensitivity. To do that, navigate to the Settings app and open it. Move to the "Display" window and scroll down to the last option. Toggle on the "Screen protector mode" to increase the screen sensitivity.

##### 2\. Finger Re-Enrollment

Delete existing fingerprints and re-register them. This re-enrollment can sometimes improve sensitivity and help remove the issues. Here is how you can delete and re-enroll your fingerprint:

- **Step 1.** In the Settings app of your Pixel, tap "Security & Privacy." Then, press "Device Unlock" and choose "Fingerprint Unlock." The device will now ask you to provide your device PIN or password.

![navigate to security settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-14.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Tap "Fingerprint Unlock" on the following screen and delete the previously enrolled fingerprints. Then, press "Add fingerprint" and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the process.

### 10\. Other Hardware Issues

#### Problem

Persistent fingerprint sensor problems might indicate underlying [hardware issues](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/best-apps-for-android-hardware-test.html). This could go beyond common troubleshooting and might require professional help.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Inspect for Physical Damage

Thoroughly examine your Pixel device for any physical damage. These include cracks, dents, or scratches around the fingerprint sensor area. Physical damage could affect the sensor's functionality.

##### 2\. Safe Mode Check

Boot the Tecno Spark 20 device in safe mode to determine if third-party apps are causing conflicts. To do that, press the "Power" key with any volume key to access the power menu. Afterward, long-press the "Power Off" option until the "Reboot to Safe Mode" option appears on your device's screen. Press "OK" to reboot into Safe Mode and test the fingerprint sensor's functionality.

##### 3\. Professional Assessment

If you suspect hardware issues, seek professional help from authorized service centers. A clear sign of hardware issues can be visible damage or the sensor failing to function even in safe mode.

### 11\. Factory Reset as Last Resort

#### Problem

Did all other troubleshooting methods fail to resolve persistent fingerprint sensor issues? Then, a [factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/android-factory-reset-code.html) might be required to revert the Tecno Spark 20 device to its original settings.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Backup Data

Before initiating a factory reset, ensure that all crucial data is safeguarded. This encompasses contacts, photos, documents, and any other significant files. Use Google's backup services or third-party apps to securely [back up your data](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/).

##### 2\. Initiating Factory Reset

Proceed with the following steps to execute a factory reset on your Pixel device:

- **Step 1.** On your Pixel smartphone, navigate to Settings and access the "System" tab. Here, scroll down to the bottom and tap "Reset Options."

![head to system settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-17.jpg)

- **Step 2.** In "Reset Options," choose "Erase All Data (Factory Reset)” to continue. Afterward, select "Erase All Data" on the next screen and follow the instructions to complete the process.
