To make it easier for its users to locate, lock, or erase their devices remotely, Google has developed a dedicated feature of the Android Device Manager. It is also commonly known as “Find My Device” as it is mostly used to locate a lost (or stolen) device. Though you can use this feature to ring your device, lock it, unlock it, or erase it remotely. You can access it from anywhere by providing your Google credentials and resolving the forgot pattern Android problem.

All of this can be done by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Launch a web browser of any device and go to the Android Device Manager website by clicking right here: <https://www.google.com/android/find>.

**Step 2.** You need to provide your Google credentials to sign in. Remember, this should be the same Google account that is linked to your device.

**Step 3.** After signing in, select the target Android device.

**Step 4.** You will get the location of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G device with several other options (lock, erase, and ring).

**Step 5.** Click on the “Lock” button to reset its password.

**Step 6.** It will open a new pop-up window. From here, you can provide the new password for your device.

**Step 7.** After confirming your password, you can also provide an optional recovery message and phone number (if your device has been lost or stolen).

This will automatically reset the old pattern on your device to the new password.

However, it can be an effective way to regain access to your device when other methods have failed. Here's how to do it:

**Step 1:** Turn off your Samsung device and connect it to your computer. Now press and hold “Volume Up” and “Power” keys for a while. Release the keys once the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G device enters Recovery Mode.

**Step 2:** In Recovery Mode, use the Volume keys to navigate to “Wipe data/factory reset” and select it with the “Power” key. Confirm the action on the next screen by selecting “Factory data reset.”
