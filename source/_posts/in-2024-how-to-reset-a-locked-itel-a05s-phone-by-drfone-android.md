**SamFw FRP Tool** is a viable option for users with FRP lock issues, particularly on Samsung devices. Its interface and effectiveness in removing FRP are noteworthy features. However, limitations arise with its Windows-only compatibility, which may impact user experience.

In comparison, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) is a great alternative. Its design, fast unlocking process, and compatibility make it a versatile and reliable choice. The tool’s ability to bypass FRP without a PIN or Google Account adds to its appeal. Test both apps to see which one works best for your needs.
