We will explore conventional solutions that can address Pixel fingerprint problems. Each solution will also explain the underlying reasons for the **Pixel 6 fingerprint sensor** issue.

### 1\. Fingerprint Sensor Not Touched Firmly

#### Problem

If the fingerprint sensor fails to recognize your fingerprint, it might be due to inadequate pressure. This could also be due to improper finger placement on the sensor.

#### Solution: Firm Placement

Ensure you firmly place your finger on the sensor, covering it entirely. Avoid too much pressure, but make sure the sensor fully contacts your fingerprint.

![gently press fingerprint sensor](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-5.jpg)

### 2\. Device Showing Glitches

#### Problem

Glitches or software bugs in your Pixel device may cause disruptions. This can include issues with the fingerprint sensor's functionality. These problems can range from minor issues to severe software glitches.

#### Solution: Restart Your Pixel Device

One of the easiest and simplest solutions is to restart your Pixel phone. You can do that by pressing the "Power" and the "Volume Up" keys. It will lead to a pop-up power menu where you must choose "Restart" to reboot your device.

![restart google pixel device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-6.jpg)

### 3\. Outdated Firmware

#### Problem

An outdated operating system or firmware can lead to compatibility issues. This can lead to malfunctioning features like the **Pixel 6A fingerprint sensor not working**.

#### Solution: Check for Updates

The best way to resolve this issue is to update your Pixel device. Having an outdated version of Android OS can lead to an accumulation of bugs and glitches. Moreover, it can seriously affect the Vivo Y36i device's performance, causing many issues. Here is how to check and update your Pixel phone:

**Instructions.** On your Pixel device, access the “Settings” app. Within Settings, scroll down to tap the "System" option. On the following screen, hit the "System update" option to check if any latest update is available. Here, if you see any updates, download and install them promptly.

![update device to latest version](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-7.jpg)

### 4\. Dirty Phone or Sensor

#### Problem

Accumulated dirt, dust, or residue on the phone or fingerprint sensor can cause obstruction. This can lead to the failure to properly recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone

Employ a gentle, dry microfiber cloth for wiping down the complete surface of your Pixel device. Take particular care to thoroughly clean the region surrounding the fingerprint sensor. Refrain from utilizing rough substances or strong chemicals as they could potentially cause harm to the Vivo Y36i device.

##### 2\. Fingerprint Sensor Cleaning

Gently wipe the fingerprint sensor area using a clean, dry cloth to ensure thorough cleaning. For better results, consider using a dampened cotton swab with water or isopropyl alcohol. Before using it again, ensure the sensor is entirely dry.

##### 3\. Compressed Air or Soft Brush

Use compressed air or a soft brush if there's visible debris or particles around the sensor. Be cautious not to apply excessive pressure that might damage the sensor.

![dirty sensor or phone issue](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-8.jpg)

### 5\. Screen Protector: Dirty or Damaged

#### Problem

A smudged or impaired screen protector might disrupt the working of the fingerprint sensor. This can potentially cause it to fail to recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Clean the Screen Protector

Start by effectively cleaning the screen protector on your Pixel device. For a thorough cleaning, consider utilizing a screen cleaning solution. Ensure that the screen protector is free from any dirt or debris.

##### 2\. Replace Damaged Protectors

Is the screen protector visibly damaged, scratched, or peeling off? If yes, consider replacing it with a new one. Damaged protectors can hinder fingerprint recognition and compromise device protection.

##### 3\. Check Compatibility

Ensure the screen protector is designed to be compatible with fingerprint sensors. Some protectors may obstruct or interfere with the sensor's functionality.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleanse and Dry Your Hands

## How to Unlock a Network Locked Vivo Y36i Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Vivo Y36i phones refusing to work with different carriers.
