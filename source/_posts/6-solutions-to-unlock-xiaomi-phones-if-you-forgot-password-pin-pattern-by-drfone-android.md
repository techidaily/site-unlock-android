If your Xiaomi device runs on Android 4.4 and previous versions, then you can easily move past the password/pattern lock without any trouble.

Again, keep pressing the buttons until you see the recovery mode menu. This technique works with most Xiaomi devices, but it can differ slightly from one model to another.

- **Step 2.** Choose “Wipe Data/Factory Reset.” You can use the Volume up and down key to navigate the options and the power/home key to select anything.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone
