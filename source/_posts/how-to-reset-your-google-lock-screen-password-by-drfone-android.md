To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.
- **4\. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.
- **5\. Regularly Back Up Your Data**: Make it a habit to consistently [back up your device data](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). To prevent potential data loss from forgotten passwords or unexpected issues, take precautions.
