## Part 1: Lock System About Infinix Note 30 5G  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Infinix Note 30 5G  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Infinix Note 30 5G  is one of the older versions of Infinix  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Infinix Note 30 5G  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Infinix Note 30 5G  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Infinix Note 30 5G  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.

## Part 2: 5 Solutions to Unlock Infinix Note 30 5G  Without Password or Pattern

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Infinix Note 30 5G  with Find My Device.

Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Infinix  device using your Google Account.

![Infinix Note 30 5G  lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-02.jpg)

- At the bottom left corner, tap the “Forgotten Password” option.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Infinix Note 30 5G  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Infinix Note 30 5G  with the power button.
