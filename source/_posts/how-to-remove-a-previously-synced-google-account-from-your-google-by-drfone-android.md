## Unlocking the Power of Smart Lock: A Beginner's Guide for Google Pixel 8 Pro Users

Google constantly comes up with features to simplify the way users interact and complete tasks on the Android platform. One of the most important features that techies loved to debate about was the Smart Lock Android, a secure password manager functioning in sync with a Google account on the Android phone.

## Part 1: What is Android Smart Lock?

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162221345.jpg)

Android Lollipop added a feature called Smart Lock, and the feature was devised as a smart tool to prevent the Android phone from locking once it was initially unlocked. In other words, the feature overrides an Android phone's Lock Screen feature, thereby saving users the need to enter passwords every time the Google Pixel 8 Pro device locks.

If you're at home, it's likely your android phone is locked out if you haven't accessed at for some time. Smart Locks solves the problem in many ways. It allows you to allocate trusted places. Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won't lock. Trusted devices come next. Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162911081.jpg)

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555165271526.jpg)

Finally, trusted face unlocking is the ultimate face recognition system that unlocks your Android device as soon as you look at it across the front-facing camera. A face unlock first introduced with Android Jelly Bean and has been significantly improved in later versions.

_Turning On Smart Lock_

The feature is enabled by first accessing settings. For example, in a Samsung Galaxy S6:

Tap on Settings, which is the gear symbol.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555171833750.jpg)

- â¢ Click on Personal and tap on Security.
- â¢ Go to Advanced and tap on Trust agents and make sure Smart Lock is turned on.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555174399892.jpg)

- â¢ Under Screen Security tap Smart Lock.
- â¢ Here, you need to enter your Screen Lock. If you haven't done so, set up a password and PIN by following the on-screen prompts. The screen Lock is needed every time you have to change the Smart Lock settings.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555175242280.jpg)

Within Smart Lock, there are three options for setting the system. You can set up trusted devices, trusted face, and trusted places individually, combining two or all three at the same time. You can choose just one trusted face, but you have the option to set up as many trusted devices and trusted places as needed.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555176091774.jpg)

## Part 2: Turn On Smart Lock For Android with Trusted Devices

You can decide on a trusted device to be paired with Smart Lock Android.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555177245258.jpg)

For example, you can set up a Smart Lock for Bluetooth in your Android Bluetooth settings. It can also be done for Android NFC unlock devices. Examples include the Bluetooth system in your car, NFC unlocks, android sticker on the car's phone dock, or Bluetooth in your watch.

- â¢ Go to Settings.
- â¢ Tap on Security and then Smart Lock.
- â¢ Existing paired options are listed under Trusted Devices.
- â¢ Initially, trusted devices will show None.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555179612746.jpg)

Tap on Add Trusted Devices.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555180455802.jpg)

The next screen is the Choose Device Type.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555181196889.jpg)

Since you have already paired Bluetooth, it will ask you to choose the Google Pixel 8 Pro device from the list.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555182031784.jpg)

- â¢ As an example, let's take the case of LG HBS800. It may show Not connected until you add it.
- â¢ It will show up under Trusted devices in the Smart Lock menu.
- â¢ When you turn the added device on, Smart Lock now unlocks the Android mobile.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555183103300.jpg)

Similarly, other Bluetooth and NFC unlock android supported gadgets can be added under the list of Trusted Devices.

## Part 3: Turn On Smart Lock For Android With Trusted Locations

You can also add locations or addresses to Smart Lock Trusted Locations, and the phone unlocks automatically as soon as you arrive at the desired location. For example, you can set up your home or work address under Trusted Locations.

Check current settings first.

- â¢ The phone is now configured for the work address and will unlock whenever you are at the location.
- â¢ Since it works on Google Maps, the feature works through an Internet connection.

## Part 4: Turn On Smart Lock For Android With Trusted Face

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555207782388.jpg)

The feature recognizes your face and then unlocks the Google Pixel 8 Pro device. Once you set up the Google Pixel 8 Pro device to recognize your face as a trusted face, it will unlock the Google Pixel 8 Pro device as soon as it recognizes you.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555208588486.jpg)

PRECAUTION:Â  At best, this can be the first level of security, as one who resembles you to some extent can unlock the Google Pixel 8 Pro device. Photographs are not stored in the system. The device does hold necessary data to recognize your face, and the security level is determined by how good the Google Pixel 8 Pro device is configured. The data is not accessed by any app or loaded onto a Google server for backup.

_Setting Up Trusted Face_

- â¢ Go to Smart Lock and tap Trusted Face.
- â¢ Tap on Setup. Follow on-screen instructions.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555210728317.jpg)

The device begins to gather data about your face. The trusted face icon appears. As a backup, in case Smart Lock does not recognize your face, use the manual system by applying the PIN or password to unlock the Google Pixel 8 Pro device.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555211623749.jpg)

In case Trusted Face is not required, tap on reset Trusted Face appearing under the Trusted Face menu. Tap on Reset to reset the option.

_How To Improve Facial Recognition In Your Bluetooth and Android NFC Unlock Devices_

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555212902436.jpg)

- â¢ If you feel facial recognition is not up to the mark, go to Smart Lock and tap on a Trusted face.
- â¢ Tap on Improve face matching.
- â¢ Tap on Next and follow instructions on the screen to complete the task.

Smart Lock Android is a great feature and is only going to improve on time. With added security measures being introduced by Google for Bluetooth and NFC unlock android devices, including configuration to Google maps and Gmail, the feature may be one of the most important features to overcome constant blocking of devices even in protected places.

## Still Using Pattern Locks with Google Pixel 8 Pro? Tips, Tricks and Helpful Advice

They have been along for a long, long time now â pattern locks â the easiest of all smartphone locks. You just swipe your finger across to create an **easy pattern lock** of your choosing and thatâs it, it becomes your new screen lock. No more remembering tedious digits! So, why have these easy pattern locks become outdated, and why do people still continue to use them? Letâs take a dive and find out all about pattern locks.

![creating more secure pattern locks](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-1.jpg)

## Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks

The first cellphone locks were 4-digit number locks. Then came 6-digit codes, and even alphanumeric ones. Pattern locks were all the rage a while ago. Though pattern locks continue to be used, they are not considered safe to use any longer. What is all that about? Hereâs what you need to know about pattern locks, whether you are a seasoned pattern lock user or not.

### I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?

Believe it or not, technology has advanced at such a rapid pace in the last two decades that youâd be forgiven if you donât know what a pattern lock is, especially if you have only ever used iPhones, or Android phones in just the last few years.

Pattern locks are patterns you create on your smartphone and designate as a smartphone lock/ screen lock. There is a 9-point keypad of sorts, and you start swiping your finger from any point to any point for any which way you feel like. Android 13 allows a minimum of 4 points registered. They are easy to create, and easy to use, hence called easy pattern locks.

Pattern locks have only ever been offered on Android devices and were commonplace a few years ago until they were deemed not secure enough for use by modern standards because they were _easy_ to figure out by malicious actors.

### I.II: Popularity and Usage

Pattern lock is a feature unique to Android and has been so since the start. Naturally, it is one of the preferred ways users have come to unlock their Android devices over the years. Even though modern Android smartphones come with fingerprint recognition and face recognition technologies, there exists a large subset of users still addicted to and acclimatized with the pattern lock feature, opting over fingerprint and face recognition.

There has been, however, research conducted into the safety and security offered by pattern lock in Android.

### I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks

Modern smartphones very nearly contain the entirety of our lives; photo memories, video memories, important documents both financial and personal in nature, banking apps, ID and ATM/ credit cards in the âwalletâ apps, and whatnot. A smartphone falling into the wrong hands could very nearly be used to devastate the rightful owner, both financially and otherwise. And this is not a claim out of thin air; spyware/ malware/ phishing attacks are on the rise around the world. Locking the smartphone, once considered optional and an unnecessary hassle, is now an absolute must.

#### Advantages of Pattern Locks

There is no denying that using an **easy pattern lock** to lock their smartphone seems enough for most users. Swiping your finger across your smartphone to unlock it feels not only cool and futuristic but safer and more secure than remembering and punching in digits. And, for the most part, it is true, given that 4-digit PINs can only have 10,000 unique combinations!

#### Disadvantages of Pattern Locks

While very easy to use, security researchers and experts have come to agree that the feature is not in the least safe to use, and that is because of how people use the pattern lock feature (discussed in detail below in part II). Some go so far as to say that most pattern locks can be breached in just 5 attempts or less. Imagine that!

What is more, research has found that humans have an uncanny ability to correctly guess a pattern lock simply by viewing the unlocking! The test comprised showing the test subjects videos of users unlocking their phones from different angles and varying distances, and it was found that around 64% of test subjects were able to correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock in one viewing only, and 80% could correctly guess the pattern after just two viewings. By contrast, only 11% were able to correctly deduce a 6-digit PIN after one viewing, and only 27% after viewing twice. This goes to show just how insecure pattern locks are!

## Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks

We might wonder how anyone would be able to guess the correct pattern of our device, but believe it or not, it is possible, eerily easily at that! We are all the same humans, after all! You know how people usually set PINs that could be significant dates in their lives? How they get car registration numbers that mean something to them? The same âlogicâ applies to their setting pattern locks.

At DEFCON 23, Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, presented something that stunned people around the world. She said, âTell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.â What followed was an expert presentation outlining and detailing user behaviors around pattern locks.

These are some commonly created pattern locks by people:

- \- shapes of alphabets,
- \- shapes of numerals,
- \- any other easy-to-make, simple shape.

Marte Loge presented the image below, showing how people naturally gravitate towards creating simple shape patterns, in her research.

![common pattern locks](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-2.jpg)

To further help you see how easy it might be for anyone to guess your pattern, Marte Loge also presented some statistics.

- \- 77% of people started their patterns in one of the 4 corners.
- \- 44% of Logeâs subjects started their pattern with the first dot, the top-left one. The next number was 15% for the top-right and 14% for the bottom-left.
- \- These percentages did not vary much depending on left-handedness or right-handedness.
- \- On average, irrespective of gender, people set 5-point patterns, with 4-point patterns being the most common. This means that the number of combinations on average was 7152 for 5-point patterns and a bogglingly low 1624 for 4-point patterns.

The above data makes it amply clear how using an **easy pattern lock** is actually worse than using a 4-digit PIN, simply because how people are usually using the pattern lock feature.

## Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks

Now, we know how hard it is to break habits cemented over years of use, so in case you must at all costs use a pattern lock only, the least you can do is try and change your easy pattern lock to a better, more secure hard pattern lock.

#### III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns

Here are some tips to help you create a better, more secure pattern lock for your smartphone.

- \- Avoid using any of the corners to start the pattern.
- \- Never use your first initial as a pattern.
- \- Never use a digit shape as a pattern.
- \- You can pass through the same pattern lines multiple times over. This makes it more difficult for someone to guess your pattern correctly.
- \- Use all 9 points on the grid while setting the pattern lock! That simple act takes the possible pattern combinations to over 140,000, significantly more than 10,000 for 4-digit PINs, and vastly superior to paltry 1624 for a 4-point **easy pattern lock**!

#### III.II: Forgot Your Pattern? Unlock Your Google Pixel 8 Pro Without Pattern Lock With Dr.Fone

Supercharged with the information above, you went ahead and changed your easy pattern lock to a hard-to-guess pattern lock. Only problem is, your brain is habituated to that old pattern, and youâve suddenly forgotten what the new pattern was! Well, worry not; Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) will help you [unlock your phone without pattern lock](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/pattern-lock.html)!
