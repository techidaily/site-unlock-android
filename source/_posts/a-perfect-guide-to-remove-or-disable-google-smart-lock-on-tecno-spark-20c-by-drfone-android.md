This article goes through the details of Google Smart Lock and its significance. It offers a solution to address unexpected screen lock scenarios on Android devices.

![disabling google smart lock feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-remove-or-disable-google-smart-lock-1.jpg)

## Part 1. Understanding Google Smart Lock and How It Works?

Want to know **what is Google Smart Lock**? [Google Smart Lock](https://get.google.com/smartlock/) serves as a multi-purpose tool within the Google ecosystem. It is designed to streamline security measures and password management access across platforms. At its core, Google Smart Lock operates as a feature that manages passwords. Google Smart Lock aims to enhance authentication processes. Primarily, it operates across Android devices and computers.

It offers a unified approach to security, ensuring you don’t have to remember all the passwords. Google Smart Lock securely stores and manages passwords for websites and apps. It enables users to access these services without repeatedly entering login details. When you visit a familiar website or app, Google Smart Lock fills in the login credentials. It automatically provides the login ID and password, maintaining effortless access.

## Part 2. Recognizing Some Top Features of Google Smart Lock

Google Smart Lock’s password management has revolutionized how users handle and secure their login credentials. It remains a cornerstone when handling Android devices and computer systems. The following are several notable features that significantly enhance user convenience and security:

### 1\. Password Autofill

Google Smart Lock simplifies the login process across apps and websites. It does that by automatically filling in saved credentials. This eliminates the need for users to remember and manually input passwords.

### 2\. Cross-Platform Synchronization

It synchronizes saved passwords across multiple devices using the same Google account. This ensures smooth access to credentials on Android devices and computers.

### 3\. Secure Storage

Passwords stored within Google Smart Lock are encrypted and securely stored in the user's Google account. This maintains confidentiality and safeguards sensitive login information.

### 4\. Effortless Password Generation

It allows the creation of strong and unique passwords when signing up for new accounts. That enhances overall account security and allows users to have strong passwords.

These features significantly ease the burden of password management and enhance user security. Yet, **Google Smart Lock** does have limitations that prompt some users to consider removing it.

## Part 3. Why Is It Essential To Remove Google Smart Lock?

Despite its array of benefits, there are times when users consider removing or disabling Google Smart Lock. Described below are these limitations to better grasp why users might choose to **Google Smart Lock turn off**:

### 1\. Privacy Concerns

Some users focus on privacy and feel uncomfortable with Google Smart Lock's access to their passwords. The reason behind this is how easily anyone can access the saved password. All they need to do is access "Manage Passwords" in Google Chrome, and all their passwords will be open. This leads them to opt for more private password management options.

### 2\. Glitches and Technical Issues

Technical glitches in the functioning of Google Smart Lock can be frustrating. This is especially prominent when managing passwords with similar usernames across different websites. The same can happen when using similar passwords for different websites or apps. Users experiencing such issues can seek to remove it to restore regular operations.

### 3\. No Updates

You should be aware that Google Smart Lock for Passwords has been deprecated. This indicates it no longer receives updates or support from Google. Developers are advised to opt for Google's One Tap Sign-in feature as an alternative by Google. It provides a more efficient and secure method for signing in to apps and websites.

### 4\. Preference for Third-Party Tools

Certain users might have a preference for specialized third-party password management tools. They can go for solutions that offer a wider array of features. Many users might want to find options better aligned with their specific needs. This prompts them to disable Google Smart Lock.

## Part 4. Understanding Some Effective Ways To Disable or Remove Google Smart Lock

## Part 2. How to Unlock Android Phone with Aroma File Manager (with Data Loss)/h2>

If you weren't able to open your Wi-Fi or data connection or enable USB Debugging, this is the way for you to unlock your lock screen. This could be a bit complicated, but it should work.

**Steps are provided below, and please follow the step-by-step guide carefully to avoid a boot loop or any other damage.**

**Step 1.** Download [Aroma File Manager](https://code.google.com/archive/p/rom-cmexmini/downloads) on your PC. This is a tool that unlocks Android phones. Android users can use it for free.

![Aroma File Manager download page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14647610652100.jpg)

**Step 2.** Go to your Downloads folders and copy the downloaded zip file.

![Copy Aroma zip file](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14647610755085.jpg)

**Step 3.** Plug into your PC a memory card that you can insert into your phone later. Then, go to your list of connected devices and select the memory card.

![open memory card on pc](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14647610775226.jpg)

**Step 4.** Paste the copied Aroma zip file. Once copied, eject it from your PC, then insert it into your Android device.

![Paste aroma file manager](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14647610796449.jpg)

![arom file manager pasted](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14647610819837.jpg)

**Step 5.** Enter Recovery Mode for your device. Each Android device has its own ways of entering recovery mode, so take a look at this [link](http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/use-recovery-mode-android/) and find your device.

![Enter recovery mode android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14647615647569.jpg)

**Step 6.** When you are already in Android Recovery Mode, use your volume keys to navigate to ''apply update from external storage'', then select the zip file you copied a while ago. It will be flashed on your device.

![Android system recovery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14647615657193.jpg)

**Step 7.** After it, restart, and recovery mode will reopen as Aroma File Manager, so go to its settings and select ''Automount all devices on start'', then restart. Back in Aroma File Manager, go to the directory data>system. Check if the ff. exist. If they do, delete them. Then restart again.

- signature.key
- sparepassword.key

![arom file manager](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14647610871048.jpg)

Now you have your device booted up, and your Android lock screen is still locked, just gesture in or enter anything. It will be unlocked. And that's how to unlock an Android phone using your device.

## Part 3. How to Unlock Android Phone Using Minimal ADB and Fastboot (with Data Loss)

If you weren't able to connect to the Internet, but you, fortunately, enabled your USB Debugging option before your device was locked, the ARONSDB tool from the Android SDK package can help you unlock your Android phone.

**Here is the step-by-step guide for you to follow**

**Step 1.** Go to [Minimal ADB and Fastboot](https://androidmtk.com/download-minimal-adb-and-fastboot-tool) download page.

![Minimal adb and fastboot dowload page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313491726.jpg)

**Step 2.** Download the tool's latest version.

![Minimal adb and fastboot downloaded](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313521345.jpg)

**Step 3.** Open the downloaded Minimal ADB and Fastbootzip file and install it.

![Minimal adb and fastboot installer zip](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313544528.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot setup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313551732.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot installation complete](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313566582.jpg)

**Step 4.** Make sure your device is connected, then go to the Minimal ADB and Fastboot installation directory.

This PC \[Win 8& 10\] or My computer \[Windows 7 & below\]> Local Disk (C:) \[primary drive\]> Program Files \[for 32-bit\] or Program Files (x86) \[for 64-bit\] > Minimal ADB and Fasboot.

![Local Disk](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313589887.jpg)

![Program Files (x86) folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313591963.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313625020.jpg)

**Step 5.** Inside the folder, hold the Shift key on your keyboard, then right-click your mouse. An additional "Open command window here" will appear so select that.

![Minimal adb and fastboot open command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313653169.jpg)

**Step 6.** ADB terminal will pop out. Now, the first is to type in ADB _devices_. This is to check if your device is recognized by ADB. If there is no device listed below, try to remove and reconnect your Tecno Spark 20C and retype the command. If there are listed devices already, proceed.

![Minimal adb and fastboot command window adb devices command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317691463.jpg)

**Step 7.** Finally, type in the following commands **one by one****.** These commands will remove your lock screen.

- _adb shell_
- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.db_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';_
- _.quit_

![Minimal adb and fastboot adb shell command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317729484.jpg)

This would work if you have your USB debugging turned on before it was locked. That's how to unlock Android using ADB.

## Part 4: How to Unlock Phone via Find My Device (with Data Loss)

Google Find My Device is another handy way to unlock your locked Android device. However, it requires you to have your Google ID credentials and you have previously enabled Find My Device features. Moreover, it will erase all the data on your device. Use the following steps to unlock your Android phone via Find My Device:

**Step 1:** Open a web browser on a computer or another device and visit the Find My Device website. Now, sign in with the Google account that is linked to the locked Android device.

**Step 2:** After signing in, you will see a list of devices associated with your Google account on the left side of the screen. Select the locked Android device from the list and choose the "Erase Device" option from the menu on the left-hand side.

![tap on erase device option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/unlock-android-phone-1.jpg)

**Step 3:** You will now be asked to confirm your identity through a Google account password or using a pass-key. Afterward, follow the on-screen instructions to erase and unlock your Android device.

## Part 5: How to Unlock Android Phone without Losing Data in Safe Mode

One way to unlock your Android phone without losing the data is by utilizing Safe Mode. This method works only if the screen lock you have been using is a third-party app. Since Safe Mode disables third-party apps, you can easily use it to uninstall the problematic app. Here is **how to unlock an Android phone without losing data**:

**Step 1:** On your Android device, press and hold “Power” and “Volume Down” keys together for 3 seconds. After the Power menu becomes visible, press and hold the “Power off” option.

**Step 2:** After a while, you will see the "Safe Mode" option on your screen with some basic instructions. Now, you can use the button to boot into Safe Mode and remove the screen lock application.

## Part 6. How to Unlock Android Phone without Any Data Loss Using Google Account (Android 4.4 or lower)

If luckily, you left your Wi-Fi open and luckily connected to the internet, this is the easiest way to unlock your Android phone.

**The step-by-step guide for you to refer**

**Step 1:** Retry the incorrect password or pattern until the ''Forgotten Password/Pattern'' appears below. Then select that.

![android forgot pattern lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648495587136.jpg)

**Step 2:** Check ''Enter your Google Account details'' then tap next.

![Unlock screen enter google account details](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648495698424.jpg)

**Step 3:** Input your Google Account details, username, and password. You are done.

![Account unlock Google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648495811338.jpg)

You will be given the option to input a new password or pattern right after you enter your Google account details. But if not, Google must have emailed you your temporary password or pattern that you will input to unlock your lock screen.
