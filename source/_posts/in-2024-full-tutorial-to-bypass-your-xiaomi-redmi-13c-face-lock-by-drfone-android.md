## Full Tutorial to Bypass Your Xiaomi Redmi 13C Face Lock?

Your android phone face unlock may be buggy, or the camera may be damaged. It can't recognize your face. When you try multiple times in such cases, it will lock your device permanently. Are you stuck with a locked phone? And you're still confused about what just happened. Face unlock may face problems such as

- Face unlock app may be buggy
- Your face unlock settings may be unstable
- Your phone camera or face unlock sensor may be damaged
- Someone else may have registered their face without your permission

Whatever the reason, they are equally big obstacles for you to use your phone as usual; trying to unlock your device can lead to a permanently locked phone. So how do you bypass face unlock?

Follow the guide below to bypass the face unlock settings and choose the best one for yourself.

## How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?

If you want to bypass face lock by yourself, then different methods can help you. These are all tested and work well.

### 1\. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock

You can use your photo to manipulate the face lock app. Simply use your photo to unlock the phone, which should work fine. If your phone doesn't recognize your face from a photo, try again.

If it still doesn't recognize your face, try a different photo or even change the camera's lighting settings or the angles to see if that helps.

Anyway, this method is still unstable because of many uncontrollable factors. If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.

### 2\. Hard Reset your phone

To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.

![android hard reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-2.jpg)

**Step 1**: Turn off your phone and hold the Power and Volume-down buttons simultaneously until the recovery mode screen appears. There are minor variations depending on the brand and model.

**Step 2**: Select the Wipe data/Factory Reset option using the volume buttons. To confirm the option, press the Power button.

**Step 3**: Choose Yes > Delete All User Data, then press the power button to continue. When the process is complete, turn on your phone.

So, before facing such awkward cases, like data loss, we suggest you have a backup habit of keeping your data safe.

### 3\. Google Find My Device

Google Find My Device is a service that lets you remotely lock, track, and wipe data from stolen or lost phones. With a Google account and the password, it won't be complicated to remove any locks on your phone. You can bypass the Android lock screen by following the steps below:

![google find my device data reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-3.jpg)

**Step 1:** Navigate to Find My Device and sign in with your Google account.

**Step 2:** Your phone receives a notification.

**Step 3:** Select Erase Device, confirm, and click Erase as a warning pops up on the screen.

**Step 4:** The factory reset process on your phone begins. When it's finished, choose My Google Account instead of using your phone as if it were brand new.

Just like the hard reset, after using Google Find My Device, all your data and settings will be erased. Please make everything well prepared before you decide to unlock your device.

**Step 1.** Go to [Minimal ADB and Fastboot](https://androidmtk.com/download-minimal-adb-and-fastboot-tool) download page.

![Minimal adb and fastboot dowload page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313491726.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot installation complete](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313566582.jpg)

**Step 4.** Make sure your device is connected, then go to the Minimal ADB and Fastboot installation directory.

This PC \[Win 8& 10\] or My computer \[Windows 7 & below\]> Local Disk (C:) \[primary drive\]> Program Files \[for 32-bit\] or Program Files (x86) \[for 64-bit\] > Minimal ADB and Fasboot.

![Local Disk](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313589887.jpg)

![Program Files (x86) folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313591963.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313625020.jpg)

**Step 5.** Inside the folder, hold the Shift key on your keyboard, then right-click your mouse. An additional "Open command window here" will appear so select that.

![Minimal adb and fastboot open command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313653169.jpg)

**Step 6.** ADB terminal will pop out. Now, the first is to type in ADB _devices_. This is to check if your device is recognized by ADB. If there is no device listed below, try to remove and reconnect your Xiaomi Redmi 13C and retype the command. If there are listed devices already, proceed.

![Minimal adb and fastboot command window adb devices command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317691463.jpg)

- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where_

- _.quit_

![Minimal adb and fastboot adb shell command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317729484.jpg)

This would work if you have your USB debugging turned on before it was locked. That's how to unlock Android using ADB.

## Part 4: How to Unlock Phone via Find My Device (with Data Loss)

## Part 6. How to Unlock Android Phone without Any Data Loss Using Google Account (Android 4.4 or lower)

If luckily, you left your Wi-Fi open and luckily connected to the internet, this is the easiest way to unlock your Android phone.

**The step-by-step guide for you to refer**

**Step 1:** Retry the incorrect password or pattern until the ''Forgotten Password/Pattern'' appears below. Then select that.

![android forgot pattern lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648495587136.jpg)

**Step 2:** Check ''Enter your Google Account details'' then tap next.

![Unlock screen enter google account details](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648495698424.jpg)

![Account unlock Google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648495811338.jpg)

You will be given the option to input a new password or pattern right after you enter your Google account details. But if not, Google must have emailed you your temporary password or pattern that you will input to unlock your lock screen.

![android emergency call screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg)

## Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?

The **Android emergency call bypass** method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve [<u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html). It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.

**“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls** be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to [<u>reset your password </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html) through official channels.

### Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method

However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.

But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the **emergency call bypass** can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.

![android emergency screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg)

## Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen

Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on **how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call** feature:

- **Step 1:** Start by tapping the **Emergency Call** button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.

![android tap to add emergency contacts](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (\*). Do this several times in a row.
- **Step 3:** Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.
- **Step 4:** Go back to the lock screen. Open the **Camera** app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.
- **Step 5:** In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.
- **Step 6:** When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.
- **Step 7:** Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.

![android home screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg)

This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important. Remember, this method exploits a security flaw and should be used as a last resort.

## Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen

While the **emergency call bypass for Android** method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions. Modern devices have significantly improved security, making this method obsolete. There are other, more reliable methods for those needing to unlock their phone’s screen.

You can use the **Forgot PIN/Passcode** feature if you’ve linked your phone to a Google account. After multiple failed attempts to unlock your phone, you’ll see a prompt to reset the password via your Google account credentials.

### Method 3: Forcing a Data Reset on Your Android Phone

As a last resort, you can [<u>perform a factory reset</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-factory-reset-huawei-phone-when-locked.html). This will erase all data on your device but remove the lock screen. Access the recovery mode by pressing a combination of keys (usually volume up/down and the power button) and then selecting **Wipe data/Factory reset**.

### Method 4: Booting Into Safe Mode

Booting into safe mode can bypass third-party lock screens. This method won’t work on the default lock screen but can be helpful if an app sets the lock.

In summary, while the emergency call bypass is a thing of the past, there are still various ways to unlock your phone. There’s always a solution, whether through a sophisticated tool like Wondershare Dr.Fone or built-in Android features.

## Conclusion

This guide explored **how to bypass the Android lock screen using an emergency call.** It mainly focused on outdated **Android emergency call bypass** and more reliable alternatives. Key takeaways include understanding that while older methods like the emergency call bypass are largely ineffective on modern devices, tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone offer a safe and trusted solution.
