## How To Easily Unlock Tecno Screen?

If you've ever had a Tecno phone, then you know that their screens are locked by default. It can be a pain if you want to access your messages or change your background image quickly. If you just set your Tecno password, screen lock code, pattern lock, or PIN last night or a few days ago, you are most likely to forget it.

The result is that you have locked out of your phone, and you have to reset your device's password. But fortunately, there's an easy way to unlock your Tecno screen without entering any passwords. You can have your phone up and running in a few simple steps without contacting customer service.

So don't wait any longer - read on for instructions on how to unlock the Tecno phone pin code.

Let's get started!

## 4 Easy Ways To Unlock Tecno Screen

![sim pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/unlock-nokia-screen-1.jpg)

Like most people, you probably lock your Tecno phone as soon as you turn it on. It's a good way to keep your phone safe from prying eyes and accidental button presses. But what happens when you forget your phone's passcode? Or worse, what if your phone gets locked by a malicious app?

There are a few different ways to unlock your Tecno phone. We'll show you how to do it.

## Method 1. Google Find My Device (Without Password/Pin/Pattern)

If you're like me, you've probably tried a million different ways to unlock your Tecno phone, only to be frustrated by the results. Luckily, there's an easy way to unlock your Tecno phone using Google's Find My Device feature.

Google will use your location, phone information, and connection log to find your Nokia.

Follow these steps to unlock the Tecno lock screen password without losing data:

- **Step 1**: Sign into your Google account and navigate the Find My Device website.

![google find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/unlock-nokia-screen-2.jpg)

- **Step 2**: Sign in with your Google account, which you used on your locked Tecno phone.
- **Step 3**: The Android Device Manager dashboard will show your locked Tecno with three options: Ring, Lock, and Erase.
- **Step 4**: Simply click on "Lock".
- **Step 5**: Enter a password that is not your Google account password in the "New Password" field.
- **Step 6**: Type the new password in the "Confirm password" field. This password lock will replace the current lock screen.
- **Step 7**: You can leave the "Recovery message" field empty or type anything in it.
- **Step 8**: Enter another phone number in the "Phone number" field, although this is optional.
- **Step 9**: Choose "Lock" after entering your password and filling out the optional fields if you wish.
- **Step 10**: If the process is successful, you will receive the unlock code within a few seconds.
- **Step 11**: Navigate to the "Screen Settings" menu after unlocking your device.
- **Step 12**: Use a new password; you can use the temporary password if you want.

You can use it to unlock your Tecno if you have activated the Android Device Manager or Google Find My Device before your phone was locked.

### A few conditions, however, must be met for this to work

- You must turn on your Tecno phone.
- Before locking your phone, you must activate Google Find My Device or Android Device Manager.
- You must have your Tecno GPS turned on to use it.
- You must be connected to WiFi on your device to log into your Google account.

## Method 2. Unlock Tecno Lock Screen With Hard Reset

Follow the steps below if you want to know how to unlock the Tecno phone keypad with the hard reset, follow the steps below.

- **Step 1**: Turn off your Tecno phone.
- **Step 2**: Press the “Volume down” and “Power key” buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.

Today, smartphones are an extension of people. Securing them with a PIN, passcode, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock has become the norm. It’s like putting a digital lock on our private world.

But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.

That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn **how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call** technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.

![android emergency call screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg)

## Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?

The **Android emergency call bypass** method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve [<u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html). It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.

**“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls** be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to [<u>reset your password </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html) through official channels.

### Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method

However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.

But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the **emergency call bypass** can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.

![android emergency screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg)

## Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen

Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on **how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call** feature:

- **Step 1:** Start by tapping the **Emergency Call** button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.

![android tap to add emergency contacts](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (\*). Do this several times in a row.
- **Step 3:** Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.
- **Step 4:** Go back to the lock screen. Open the **Camera** app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.
- **Step 5:** In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.
- **Step 6:** When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.
- **Step 7:** Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.

![android home screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg)

This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important. Remember, this method exploits a security flaw and should be used as a last resort.

## Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen

While the **emergency call bypass for Android** method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions. Modern devices have significantly improved security, making this method obsolete. There are other, more reliable methods for those needing to unlock their phone’s screen.
