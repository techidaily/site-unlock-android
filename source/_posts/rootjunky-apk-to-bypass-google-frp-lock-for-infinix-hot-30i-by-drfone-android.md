## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Infinix Hot 30i

It is imperative to understand that unlocking your Infinix Hot 30i  Phone using a Gmail ID and password should be your last resort and especially if you are using an older version of Android. Among all the tricks of how to reset a Infinix Hot 30i  phone that is locked, it only works if you are running around version 4.4 KitKat or older than that. Neither less to say, in order for the step to work properly, you need your Gmail account to be properly configured with the Infinix Hot 30i device.
