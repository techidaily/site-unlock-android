## Method 1: Unlock Vivo Y100t  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern. Since these may also be easily guessed by people who are in possession of your device illegally, Google deprecated this method after Android 4.4. However, the phones running Android 4.4 or lower are still allowed to be unlocked using this method. So, if you have an old Vivo Y100t  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Vivo Y100t  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Vivo Y100t  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Vivo Y100t device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.
