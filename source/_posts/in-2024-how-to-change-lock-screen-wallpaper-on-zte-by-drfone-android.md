### What It Does

The service allows IT administrators to pre-configure settings and apps and manage other aspects of the ZTE Nubia Flip 5G device’s functionality. When a device is enrolled, it can be remotely controlled and monitored. The administrators can push updates, track device locations, remotely wipe data for security, and enforce specific compliance policies.

## Part 2: How To Remove Knox Enrollment Service on Your ZTE Nubia Flip 5G

Furthermore, this action could notify your employer of your attempt to remove Knox, which could have professional repercussions. Proceed with this method only if you know the risks and consequences.
