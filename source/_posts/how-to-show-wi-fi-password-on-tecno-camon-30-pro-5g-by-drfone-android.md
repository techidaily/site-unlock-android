## Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device

### What is Rooting?

First of all, what does rooting mean? You have probably used a Windows computer or even Linux. For the case of Windows, when installing a new program or software, it always prompts a dialog box saying, "Administrator permission required to run this program." If you don't have the administrator permission, you won't install the program. In Android, this is called rooting. In simple terms, it means having the root permission to your phone. Some Android apps will require you the root permission, e.g., flashing your ROM. In this part, we will explain how you can show the Wi-Fi password on your Android with root.

To find the Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone, you need to have an app to explore files which also supports a root user. In this case, ES FileExplorer or Root Explorer will come in handy. However, it turns out that the latter is offered at $3. Let's use the free ES File Explorer.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556285763404.jpg)

### Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root

In only four steps, we, at this moment, learn how we can find the password of a Wi-Fi on an Android phone.

Step 1: Install the ES File Explorer

Download the ES File Explorer from your play store, install it, and open it.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556286507084.jpg)

Step 2: Enable Root Explorer

The root explorer needs to be enabled so that you can reach the root folders of the Wi-Fi passwords you need. By default, the root feature in this ES explorer is not enabled. To enable it, just tap on the list menu on the top left corner.:

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556292611536.jpg)

This will drop down a list of controls. Scroll down and find the **Root Explorer** option and enable it.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293052566.jpg)

Step 3: Get the passwords' file.

Go back to ES file explorer, and this time, find the folder named **data**.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293412707.jpg)

When this folder opens, find another one named **misc**. Open it and find another one named **wifi**. Here, find a file named **wpa\_supplicant.conf**.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293762552.jpg)

Step 4: Retrieve the wifi password on Android

Make sure that you don't edit anything in the file. You might mess up with important data and fail to access the Wi-Fi(s) in the future.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556294042257.jpg)

As you can see above, we have found the Wi-Fi passwords on the android device. On each network profile, we have the name of the network represented by _name (ssid="{the name}")_, the network's password represented by _psk_, the network's access point represented by _key\_mgmt=WPA-PSK_ and its priority represented by _priority_.

## Part 2: Show Wifi Password on Android without Root

What if I don't have root access to my Android, can I still see Android Wi-Fi password? The short answer is yes. However, this is a bit involving but simple. You don't need to be a computer guru to do it, but you need to have a computer and some internet access of course. The key thing is to find a way through which we can fetch the password file from the phone without using a root access protocol in the Android. This is made possible by some little programming insight using the Windows Command prompt.

### Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root

Step 1: Access the Developer authority

To access the files that Android uses to run passwords, you must first become a developer. This is very simple.

Get your Android phone and go to settings. Scroll down and find "About phone." Tap on it and scroll down again to find Build number.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556302638925.jpg)

Tap on this "build number" 5 to 6 times until a message pops up, saying, "You are now a developer".

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556303263992.jpg)

Step 2: Enable the debugging.

Go back to Settings. Scroll down for developer options. Turn on the button for "Android/USB debugging".

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556308665697.jpg)

Step 3: Install ADB drivers.

Now, open your Windows desktop. Download and install ADB drivers. (Use this download link [adbdriver.com](http://adbdriver.com/)). You need to download and install platform tools (minimal ADB and fastboot) from [http://forum.xda-developers.com/...](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2317790) Now open the folder where you've installed the above tools. By default, it is in the Local disc _C\\windows\\system32\\platform\_tools_ location. However, you might want to locate them by searching on the windows search engine. You have to hold the Shift key and right-click inside the folder to click on"Open Command Window Here."

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329561742.jpg)

Step 4: Test the ADB

Here, we would like to test whether the ABD is working properly. To do this, connect your phone to the PC using a USB. In the command prompt, type **adb services** and then press enter. If it's working properly, you should see a device on this list.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329984622.jpg)

Step 5: Find the Android wifi password.

Now, it is time to type the given command in the command prompt and type: _adb pull /data/misc/wifi/wpa\_supplicant.conf c:/wpa\_supplicant.conf_. This will fetch the file from your phone to the local disc C drive of the PC.

Step 6: Get the wifi passwords.

Lastly, open the file with a notepad, and there you go.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556331232772.jpg)

Now you learned how to show the wifi password on your Android device.

## Full Tutorial to Bypass Your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G Face Lock?

Your android phone face unlock may be buggy, or the camera may be damaged. It can't recognize your face. When you try multiple times in such cases, it will lock your device permanently. Are you stuck with a locked phone? And you're still confused about what just happened. Face unlock may face problems such as

Follow the guide below to bypass the face unlock settings and choose the best one for yourself.

![face lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-1.jpg)

## How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?

If you want to bypass face lock by yourself, then different methods can help you. These are all tested and work well.

### 1\. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock

You can use your photo to manipulate the face lock app. Simply use your photo to unlock the phone, which should work fine. If your phone doesn't recognize your face from a photo, try again.

If it still doesn't recognize your face, try a different photo or even change the camera's lighting settings or the angles to see if that helps.

Anyway, this method is still unstable because of many uncontrollable factors. If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.

### 2\. Hard Reset your phone

To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.

![android hard reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-2.jpg)

**Step 1**: Turn off your phone and hold the Power and Volume-down buttons simultaneously until the recovery mode screen appears. There are minor variations depending on the brand and model.

**Step 2**: Select the Wipe data/Factory Reset option using the volume buttons. To confirm the option, press the Power button.

**Step 3**: Choose Yes > Delete All User Data, then press the power button to continue. When the process is complete, turn on your phone.

So, before facing such awkward cases, like data loss, we suggest you have a backup habit of keeping your data safe.

### 3\. Google Find My Device

Google Find My Device is a service that lets you remotely lock, track, and wipe data from stolen or lost phones. With a Google account and the password, it won't be complicated to remove any locks on your phone. You can bypass the Android lock screen by following the steps below:

![google find my device data reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-3.jpg)

**Step 1:** Navigate to Find My Device and sign in with your Google account.

**Step 2:** Your phone receives a notification.

**Step 3:** Select Erase Device, confirm, and click Erase as a warning pops up on the screen.

**Step 4:** The factory reset process on your phone begins. When it's finished, choose My Google Account instead of using your phone as if it were brand new.

Just like the hard reset, after using Google Find My Device, all your data and settings will be erased. Please make everything well prepared before you decide to unlock your device.
