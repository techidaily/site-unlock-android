**Here is the step-by-step guide for you to follow**

**Step 1.** Go to [Minimal ADB and Fastboot](https://androidmtk.com/download-minimal-adb-and-fastboot-tool) download page.

![Minimal adb and fastboot setup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313551732.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot installation complete](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313566582.jpg)

**Step 4.** Make sure your device is connected, then go to the Minimal ADB and Fastboot installation directory.

This PC \[Win 8& 10\] or My computer \[Windows 7 & below\]> Local Disk (C:) \[primary drive\]> Program Files \[for 32-bit\] or Program Files (x86) \[for 64-bit\] > Minimal ADB and Fasboot.

![Local Disk](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313589887.jpg)

![Program Files (x86) folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313591963.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313625020.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot command window adb devices command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317691463.jpg)

- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Infinix Smart 7 HD ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider.
