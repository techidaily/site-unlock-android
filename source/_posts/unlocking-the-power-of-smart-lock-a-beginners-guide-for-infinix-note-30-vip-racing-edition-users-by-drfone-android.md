## Unlocking the Power of Smart Lock: A Beginner's Guide for Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition Users

Google constantly comes up with features to simplify the way users interact and complete tasks on the Android platform. One of the most important features that techies loved to debate about was the Smart Lock Android, a secure password manager functioning in sync with a Google account on the Android phone.

## Part 1: What is Android Smart Lock?

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162221345.jpg)

Android Lollipop added a feature called Smart Lock, and the feature was devised as a smart tool to prevent the Android phone from locking once it was initially unlocked. In other words, the feature overrides an Android phone's Lock Screen feature, thereby saving users the need to enter passwords every time the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device locks.

If you're at home, it's likely your android phone is locked out if you haven't accessed at for some time. Smart Locks solves the problem in many ways. It allows you to allocate trusted places. Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won't lock. Trusted devices come next. Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555165271526.jpg)

Finally, trusted face unlocking is the ultimate face recognition system that unlocks your Android device as soon as you look at it across the front-facing camera. A face unlock first introduced with Android Jelly Bean and has been significantly improved in later versions.

_Turning On Smart Lock_

The feature is enabled by first accessing settings. For example, in a Samsung Galaxy S6:

Tap on Settings, which is the gear symbol.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555171833750.jpg)

- • Click on Personal and tap on Security.
- • Go to Advanced and tap on Trust agents and make sure Smart Lock is turned on.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555174399892.jpg)

- • Under Screen Security tap Smart Lock.
- • Here, you need to enter your Screen Lock. If you haven't done so, set up a password and PIN by following the on-screen prompts. The screen Lock is needed every time you have to change the Smart Lock settings.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555175242280.jpg)

Within Smart Lock, there are three options for setting the system. You can set up trusted devices, trusted face, and trusted places individually, combining two or all three at the same time. You can choose just one trusted face, but you have the option to set up as many trusted devices and trusted places as needed.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555176091774.jpg)

## Part 2: Turn On Smart Lock For Android with Trusted Devices

- • Since it works on Google Maps, the feature works through an Internet connection.

## Part 4: Turn On Smart Lock For Android With Trusted Face

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555207782388.jpg)

The feature recognizes your face and then unlocks the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device. Once you set up the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device to recognize your face as a trusted face, it will unlock the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device as soon as it recognizes you.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555208588486.jpg)

PRECAUTION:  At best, this can be the first level of security, as one who resembles you to some extent can unlock the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device. Photographs are not stored in the system. The device does hold necessary data to recognize your face, and the security level is determined by how good the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device is configured. The data is not accessed by any app or loaded onto a Google server for backup.

_Setting Up Trusted Face_

- • Go to Smart Lock and tap Trusted Face.
- • Tap on Setup. Follow on-screen instructions.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555210728317.jpg)

The device begins to gather data about your face. The trusted face icon appears. As a backup, in case Smart Lock does not recognize your face, use the manual system by applying the PIN or password to unlock the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555211623749.jpg)

In case Trusted Face is not required, tap on reset Trusted Face appearing under the Trusted Face menu. Tap on Reset to reset the option.

_How To Improve Facial Recognition In Your Bluetooth and Android NFC Unlock Devices_

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555212902436.jpg)

- • If you feel facial recognition is not up to the mark, go to Smart Lock and tap on a Trusted face.
- • Tap on Improve face matching.
- • Tap on Next and follow instructions on the screen to complete the task.

Smart Lock Android is a great feature and is only going to improve on time. With added security measures being introduced by Google for Bluetooth and NFC unlock android devices, including configuration to Google maps and Gmail, the feature may be one of the most important features to overcome constant blocking of devices even in protected places.
