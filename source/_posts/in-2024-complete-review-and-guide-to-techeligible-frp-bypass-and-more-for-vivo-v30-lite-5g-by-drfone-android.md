## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Vivo V30 Lite 5G 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Vivo V30 Lite 5G device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

When used responsibly, these tools can help you access your phone after a factory reset even without your Google account credentials. Choose the tool that best fits your needs and proceed with caution. Use these tools responsibly and regain access to your device the right way.
