## A Complete Guide To OEM Unlocking on Itel P40+

Android, known worldwide as a major player in phone operating systems, stands out for its flexibility and open-source nature. This allows users to customize their devices extensively. However, despite this openness, certain features and capabilities can still be locked or restricted, either by Google or the Itel P40+ device manufacturer.

For those looking to truly unleash the full potential of their Android device, an OEM unlock is an essential step. This article will delve into the process of **OEM unlocking on Android**, guiding you through its benefits and how to safely perform it.

![android phone with padlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-01.jpg)

**OEM lock** might sound like technical jargon to many. However, it’s a key concept for those who wish to dive deeper into Android customization. OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer. Unlocking in this context refers to removing restrictions made by the manufacturer on the Itel P40+ device.

This process allows you to gain deeper access to the Itel P40+ device’s software. Thus, OEM unlocking is often required for customizing or modifying the system at a more advanced level.

### Why Enable OEM Unlock?

The primary reason to enable **OEM unlocking** is to gain the ability to root your device or install custom firmware, also known as ROMs. Rooting is the Android equivalent of jailbreaking. It allows users to access and modify the Itel P40+ device’s software at the deepest level.

This can enable the installation of apps and software that require more permissions than what is typically available. On the other hand, custom ROMs can change your device’s interface. They can also add features not available in the stock version of Android.

![android oem unlocking settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-02.jpg)

### Pros and Cons of OEM Unlocking

Here are some great things you can get when you **allow OEM unlock.**

- The most significant advantage is the ability to customize your device far beyond what’s possible with standard settings.
- **Root access.** It allows for rooting the phone enabling advanced features and apps.
- **Custom ROMs.** Users can install different versions of Android or entirely new operating systems.

On the other hand, here are some cons that you must consider before performing the process on your phone:

- **Security risks.** Root access can make your device more vulnerable to malware and hacking.
- **Void warranty.** OEM unlocking often voids the manufacturer’s warranty.
- **Potential for bricking.** Incorrect procedures can render the Itel P40+ device unusable, known as ‘bricking’.

### Understanding the Risks

It’s crucial to understand that OEM unlocking is not without its risks. It does open the door to several customizations and tweaks. However, it can also compromise the security of your device. There’s always a chance of bricking your phone, especially if the unlocking process isn’t followed correctly or an unstable custom ROM is installed.

Additionally, most manufacturers will void your warranty once you unlock the bootloader. This leaves you without support in case something goes wrong. So, in the next sections, you’ll be guided through the steps of OEM unlocking. You’ll also learn how to do it safely, ensuring you make the most out of your Android device.

## Part 2: How To Enable OEM Unlock on Your Android Phone

**Enabling OEM unlock** can feel like stepping into uncharted territory. Still, it’s relatively straightforward if you follow the right steps. Before you start, it’s important to remember that the exact process can vary slightly depending on your device’s brand and model. However, the general steps are usually similar across most Android devices.

![android developer options](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-03.jpg)

- **Step 1:** Before proceeding, ensure you [<u>back up all important data</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup/android-backup-software.html). Enabling OEM unlock may require a factory reset, which erases all data on the Itel P40+ device.
- **Step 2:** Go to your phone’s Settings > About Phone. Then, tap on the Build number seven times. You should see a message that says you’re now a developer.
- **Step 3:** Find and select Developer options on Settings. Then, tap **OEM unlocking**. You might need to enter a PIN or password.

Here are some common links where you might find the needed PIN or password:

- [<u>HTC</u>](https://www.htcdev.com/bootloader/)
- [<u>LG</u>](https://developer.lge.com/resource/mobile/RetrieveBootloader.dev?categoryTypeCode=ANRS)
- [<u>Sony</u>](https://developer.sonymobile.com/unlockbootloader/unlock-yourboot-loader/)
- [<u>Huawei</u>](https://community.gethuawei.com/developers/f/48/t/1048)
- [<u>Motorola</u>](https://www.motorola.com/https://accounts.motorola.com/ssoauth/login?TARGET=https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/cc/cas/sso/redirect/standalone%2Fbootloader%2Funlock-your-device-b)
- [<u>Samsung</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-unlock-codes.html)

After these steps, your device’s bootloader is now unlocked, and you can proceed with rooting or installing custom ROMs. Remember that this is a significant change to your device’s system, and it should be done cautiously and ideally only if you’re comfortable with potential risks.

## Part 3: What Can You Do After OEM Unlock?

Unlocking your phone’s OEM opens up a world of possibilities. It allows you to customize your device beyond what’s available in its factory settings. This newfound freedom, however, comes with its own set of responsibilities and risks. Here’s what you can do after having your phone **OEM unlocked**.

![android custom roms](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-04.jpg)

### Root Your Device

Rooting is akin to having the master key to your device’s software. It allows you to gain superuser access, enabling modifications and access to system files that were previously restricted. With rooting, you can:

- Remove pre-installed apps or bloatware.
- Customize system settings and UI elements.
- Enhance performance or battery life through underclocking or overclocking the CPU.

### Flash a Custom ROM

A custom ROM is a new operating system you can install on your device. This is one of the most popular reasons for OEM unlocking. Custom ROMs offer:

- The latest Android updates, even for older devices, are no longer supported by manufacturers.
- New features and customization options that aren’t available in the stock ROM.
- Potential performance improvements and unique user interfaces.

### Enjoy High Customization

With an OEM unlocked device, the sky’s the limit regarding customization. You can:

- Install custom kernels for better performance and battery life.
- Use powerful apps that require root access for advanced device management.
- Customize everything from the boot animation to the layout of your UI.

However, it’s crucial to proceed with caution. Rooting and installing custom ROMs can void your warranty and, if not done correctly, can turn your device into an expensive paperweight (a state often referred to as “bricking”). Always use reliable sources for your custom ROMs and root-access apps.
