Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Tecno  device using your Google Account.

![Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G  lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-02.jpg)

- Enter a random password or PIN on your phone's lock screen five times.
- Wait for the system to give the alert message after you enter the wrong password five times.
- Now, wait for 30 seconds until the system asks you to enter your lock screen password.
- At the bottom left corner, tap the “Forgotten Password” option.
- Now the system will ask for your Google account and password.
- After you verify your Google account, you can enter your device.

### 3: Answer Security Questions

This method does not work on all Tecno  devices, but you can use it for **Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G  screen unlock without PC**. You will see various questions if your Google account is linked with the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G device. All questions are based on your profile and credentials. You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G  with security questions.

![Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G  forgot pattern interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-03.jpg)

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G  with the power button.

![power key](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-04.jpg)
