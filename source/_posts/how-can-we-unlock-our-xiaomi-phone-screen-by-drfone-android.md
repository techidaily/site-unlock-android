Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Xiaomi 14 Ultra  with Find My Device.

Here are the steps for **Xiaomi 14 Ultra  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Xiaomi 14 Ultra  with the power button.
