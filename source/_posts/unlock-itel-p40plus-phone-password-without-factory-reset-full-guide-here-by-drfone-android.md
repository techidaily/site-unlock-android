Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern.

So, if you have an old Itel P40+  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Itel P40+  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Itel P40+  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:
