This simplifies device usage by eliminating the need to input passwords or security codes. The basic working of this aspect of Google Smart Lock, now known as “Extend Unlock,” is divided into three parts.

The first one is on-body detection, which keeps the Vivo S18 Pro device unlocked when it's carried or held by the user. The other two are “Trusted Places” and “Trusted Devices.” Users can set specific locations, like home or work, as "Trusted Places." When the Vivo S18 Pro device is within these locations, it remains unlocked and accessible. Smart Lock integrates biometric authentication methods to unlock devices.

As helpful as it is in managing access to your Android device, privacy concerns can cause users to disable this lock. The following are the steps you can **take to disable Google Smart Lock**/Extend Unlock via Android settings:

- **Step 1.** Access “Settings” on your Android device and scroll down to tap "Passwords & security." Here, press the option labeled as "Privacy."
