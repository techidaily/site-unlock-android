## Part 1: Ways That Honor Lets You Unlock Your Honor X50i+

Honor X50i+  are more than just smartphones; they are gateways to a personalized and secure user experience. To access the myriad of features these devices offer, Google provides several unlocking methods, ensuring both convenience and security. Here are these options:

- A Personal Identification Number (PIN) is a simple yet effective way to secure your phone. It’s a numeric code that you enter on the lock screen. Setting up a PIN is straightforward via the Honor X50i+ device’s security settings, and unlocking your phone is as easy as tapping in the correct sequence of numbers.
- Similar to a PIN but potentially more secure due to the allowance of a longer combination of numbers and letters. A passcode is ideal for those who seek an extra layer of security. You set it up in the security settings and use it to unlock your phone just like a PIN but with the added complexity of alphanumeric characters.
- **Face Unlock.Pixel’s Face Unlock** uses advanced facial recognition software. It scans your face to grant access, offering a hands-free and quick way to unlock your Pixel. This feature can be activated in the security settings and requires a simple glance at your phone to unlock.

![woman holding a Honor X50i+  ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/google-pixel-7-unlock-02.jpg)

- [**<u><b>Fingerprint Unlock</b></u>**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/google-pixel-frp-bypass.html)**.** This method uses your unique fingerprint as a key. It’s fast, secure, and convenient. The Pixel 6a, 6, and 7 fingerprint scanners are actually under the display. Register your fingerprint in the settings, then touch the sensor to gain access.
- **Pattern**. If you prefer a more visual method, the [<u>pattern lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mi-pattern-lock.html)lets you draw a specific shape or pattern on the screen to unlock your phone. It’s a fun and interactive way to secure your device. Create your pattern in the security settings, and unlock your phone by replicating it on the lock screen.

In essence, each unlocking method offered by the Honor X50i+  provides a blend of security and ease. Whichever unlocking method you prefer, Google ensures that accessing your phone is secure and convenient. All you need to do is set up your preferred method in the Honor X50i+ device’s settings and use it to unlock your phone.

### Method 2: Entering Into Safe Mode

- **Force resetting your device**. To force reset your Honor, press and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously to enter recovery mode. Use the volume buttons to navigate to **Wipe data/factory reset**and select it with the power button. This will get rid of existing password locks.
- **Flashing a new ROM**. This is more complex and typically requires downloading a new firmware and flashing tool. It’s only recommended for advanced users or as a last resort.

Remember, while these methods can effectively unlock your device, they also come with risks. Always [<u>back up your data regularly</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup/android-backup-software.html), and use these methods responsibly, considering their potential to erase your data or affect your device’s warranty.

## Bonus: How To Perform a SIM Unlock on Honor

[<u>Unlocking the SIM </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/android-sim-unlock-code-generator.html) on your Honor, particularly the Honor X50i+  , opens up a world of flexibility, especially for those who frequently travel or wish to switch carriers. This process can be accomplished for free through your carrier, provided certain conditions are met. Dive into the steps and considerations for performing a SIM unlock on your Honor.

### Understanding the Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the SIM unlock, ensure you’re in good standing with your carrier. This means:

- No outstanding bills.
- Your contract for the phone has expired.
- The device has been in your possession for at least 60-90 days.

Different carriers have varying requirements for a SIM unlock, so your first move should be to contact them for specific details.

### Steps for SIM Unlock Through Your Carrier

Here are the steps to SIM **unlock your Honor X50i+**,These generally involve the following steps but are still subject to the official instructions of your carrier:

![sim and unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/%20google-pixel-7-unlock-10.jpg)

- **Step 1:** Open the Phone app and dial \*#06# on your Honor. This will display your phone’s IMEI number. Note this number down for future reference.
- **Step 2:** Call your carrier and request a SIM unlock code. You’ll likely need to provide your Honor’s IMEI number.
- **Step 3:** If you meet your carrier’s requirements, they will email you the SIM unlock code within 2-5 days.
- **Step 4:** Once you receive the code, replace your current SIM with one from a different carrier. When prompted, enter the SIM unlock code you received via email.

### Alternative Method: Android SIM Unlock

If your carrier cannot unlock your Honor X50i+  ’s SIM, or if you prefer a quicker solution, consider using network unlocking services. This may be websites like UnlockBase, Mobile Unlocks, etc.

This generally involves the following steps:

- **Step 1**: Like the previous method, retrieve your IMEI number by dialing \*#06# on your Pixel.
- **Step 2:** Go to the Android SIM unlock provider’s website and enter your device’s IMEI number.
- **Step 3:** Follow through with the checkout process, providing payment and contact information.

By following these steps, you can successfully unlock the SIM of your Honor device, ensuring you can enjoy your phone with the carrier of your choice, wherever your travels may take you.

### Important Considerations

Remember, unlocking the SIM doesn’t absolve you from your carrier contract. You’re still obligated to make timely payments as per your agreement. The primary advantage of unlocking your SIM is the freedom to use your Honor X50i+ with any carrier’s SIM card, offering greater flexibility and control over your mobile experience. Thus, it is encouraged not to do anything illegal to avoid future complications.

## Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?

The **Android emergency call bypass** method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve [<u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html).

**“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls** be effective?” You may ask.

However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.

But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the **emergency call bypass** can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically.

- **Step 2:** Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (\*). Do this several times in a row.
- **Step 3:** Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.
- **Step 4:** Go back to the lock screen. Open the **Camera** app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.
- **Step 5:** In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.
- **Step 6:** When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.

![android home screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg)

This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models.

### Method 2: Using “Forgot PIN/Passcode” and Google Account

You can use the **Forgot PIN/Passcode** feature if you’ve linked your phone to a Google account. After multiple failed attempts to unlock your phone, you’ll see a prompt to reset the password via your Google account credentials.

### Method 3: Forcing a Data Reset on Your Android Phone

As a last resort, you can [<u>perform a factory reset</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-factory-reset-huawei-phone-when-locked.html). This will erase all data on your device but remove the lock screen. Access the recovery mode by pressing a combination of keys (usually volume up/down and the power button) and then selecting **Wipe data/Factory reset**.

### Method 4: Booting Into Safe Mode

Booting into safe mode can bypass third-party lock screens. This method won’t work on the default lock screen but can be helpful if an app sets the lock.
