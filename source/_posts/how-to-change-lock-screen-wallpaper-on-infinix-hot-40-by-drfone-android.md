### Way 3: Unlock Pattern Lock via Factory Reset

This should only be a last option because it will completely delete your device's data and saved settings. Your device will be reset to factory settings, meaning your device's settings will get back to the same as when you first bought it.

Type the new password once, then confirm it by typing it again. This will change the password in a few minutes and the new password can be used to unlock the Infinix Hot 40 device.

### Way 5: Use Forgot Pattern Feature \[Android 4.4 Version and Earlier\]
