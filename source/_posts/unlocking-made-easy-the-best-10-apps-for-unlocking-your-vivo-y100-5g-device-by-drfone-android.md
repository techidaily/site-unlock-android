With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Vivo Y100 5G  with Find My Device.

Here are the steps for **Vivo Y100 5G  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Vivo Y100 5G  with the power button.
