## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Vivo V30 Pro 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Vivo V30 Pro device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.
