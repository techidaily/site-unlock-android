## Part 1: How To Track Your Honor Magic 5 Pro on Google Earth

This **Google Maps IMEI number tracking** issue has caused quite a buzz and controversy on the internet. It has raised many concerns regarding the safety and privacy of every smartphone user. To tell you the truth, Google Earth lacks IMEI location data and does not provide such capabilities. Thus, there is no truth in **tracking IMEI numbers through Google Earth**.

### How To Locate a Smartphone Using Google Earth

Many current smartphones include GPS receivers that allow them to pinpoint their exact location. If you know the phone's GPS coordinates, you can plug them into Google Earth to see where it is on the map.

- **Step 1:** This process won't be possible if your location services are not enabled on your phone. To do this, navigate to **Settings,** then **Location** on Android, and **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Location Services** on iOS.

![iphone location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-02.jpg)

Now, take a look at these tools' comparison.

| **Features** | **Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) ![hot icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/hot-tip.png)**  | **Android Multi Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Easy to use | Yes | Technical skills required. |
| High-success Rate | Yes | This tool may sometimes not work.  |

One of the standout features of [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) is its simplicity. The software is designed to be easy to use, even for those with little technical knowledge.
