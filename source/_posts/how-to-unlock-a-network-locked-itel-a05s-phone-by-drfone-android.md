## How to Unlock a Network Locked Itel A05s Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Itel A05s phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Itel A05s device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Itel A05s network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Itel A05s Phone is Network Locked?
