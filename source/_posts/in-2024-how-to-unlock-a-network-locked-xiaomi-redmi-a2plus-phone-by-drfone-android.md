## How to Unlock a Network Locked Xiaomi Redmi A2+ Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Xiaomi Redmi A2+ phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Xiaomi Redmi A2+ network unlock** solutions.

## How To Change Xiaomi Redmi A2+ Lock Screen Password?

Setting up a lock screen is a crucial step in protecting your phone's data. If you're not sure how to create one on your Android™ phone, we're here to help.

Your Android lock screen pin or password and your Google Account password are two passwords you use frequently. Keeping a good lock screen passcode is important.

Although you might not frequently enter your lock screen pin or password if you use a biometric unlocking method like fingerprint or facial recognition, it's still important to be familiar with it.

You'll need to reset your Google Account password if you forget it or become locked out for some other reason when you try to keep accessing all of your data. You might also need to change lock screen passcode from time to time.

![lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-change-lock-screen-password-1.jpg)


## How to Change/Set up Lock Screen Password

Select Screen Lock Type under Settings > Lock Screen. From there, you may select from a variety of lock screen options:

![how to set up password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-change-lock-screen-password-2.jpg)

**Swipe:** This lock type allows you to swipe in any direction on your screen to unlock your phone.

**Pattern:** If you opt to unlock your phone in this manner, you must create a pattern on a 3-by-3-dot grid.

**Pin:** A PIN lock is a four-digit code. Make sure you select a set of numbers that you can quickly recall.

**Password:** Your phone's highest level of security. Your password must be distinct, easily remembered, and include at least one letter and 7 characters.

Follow the setup instructions on-screen after selecting the security measure you prefer.

Additionally, you'll notice options to enable fingerprint or face biometric recognition features. Iris Scanner (S8/S8+) or Intelligent Scan (S9/S9+) may also be available on some older Samsung® models.

**Face recognition:** By holding your face directly in front of your phone's screen, you may unlock your phone and authenticate yourself in apps.

With fingerprints, you can quickly touch your finger to unlock your phone.

**Iris:** Check your eyes to make sure that only you can see the contents of your phone.

**Intelligent Scan:** A method of device unlocking that combines face and iris recognition technology.

Follow on-screen instructions if you decide to employ one of these sophisticated security technologies, or go to Settings > Biometrics and security for more customization choices.

### 10\. Other Hardware Issues

#### Problem

Persistent fingerprint sensor problems might indicate underlying [hardware issues](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/best-apps-for-android-hardware-test.html). This could go beyond common troubleshooting and might require professional help.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Inspect for Physical Damage

Thoroughly examine your Pixel device for any physical damage. These include cracks, dents, or scratches around the fingerprint sensor area. Physical damage could affect the sensor's functionality.

##### 2\. Safe Mode Check

Boot the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device in safe mode to determine if third-party apps are causing conflicts. To do that, press the "Power" key with any volume key to access the power menu. Afterward, long-press the "Power Off" option until the "Reboot to Safe Mode" option appears on your device's screen. Press "OK" to reboot into Safe Mode and test the fingerprint sensor's functionality.

##### 3\. Professional Assessment

If you suspect hardware issues, seek professional help from authorized service centers. A clear sign of hardware issues can be visible damage or the sensor failing to function even in safe mode.

### 11\. Factory Reset as Last Resort

#### Problem

Did all other troubleshooting methods fail to resolve persistent fingerprint sensor issues? Then, a [factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/android-factory-reset-code.html) might be required to revert the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device to its original settings.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Backup Data

Before initiating a factory reset, ensure that all crucial data is safeguarded. This encompasses contacts, photos, documents, and any other significant files. Use Google's backup services or third-party apps to securely [back up your data](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/).

##### 2\. Initiating Factory Reset

Proceed with the following steps to execute a factory reset on your Pixel device:

- **Step 1.** On your Pixel smartphone, navigate to Settings and access the "System" tab. Here, scroll down to the bottom and tap "Reset Options."
