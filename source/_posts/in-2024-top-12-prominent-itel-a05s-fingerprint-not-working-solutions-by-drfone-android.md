After removing the Itel A05s device from Knox Enrollment via the admin account, you may still need to uninstall the Knox app from the Android device. This can usually be done through the Itel A05s device’s settings. Navigate to ‘Apps’ in the settings menu, locate the Knox app, and select ‘Uninstall’ or ‘Disable’. Be aware that this option might not be available on all devices, depending on how Knox was configured.

For the more tech-savvy users, another method to **bypass Knox Enrollment Service** is by rooting the Itel A05s device and flashing a new ROM.
