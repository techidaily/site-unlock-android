## Part 2: 5 Solutions to Unlock Tecno Pova 5 Pro  Without Password or Pattern

### 1: Google Find My Device

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Tecno Pova 5 Pro  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Tecno Pova 5 Pro  with Find My Device.

![google find my device web home page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-01.jpg)

- Open any browser on your PC and visit "Google Find My Device."
- Make sure your phone is connected to the internet.
- Select the "Erase Device" option and log in with your Google account.
- After verification, click on "Ok" and wait for the system to factory reset.
- Power on your device and enter it without any pattern or password.

### 2: Google Account

Here is how you can do an **Tecno Pova 5 Pro  pattern unlock without PC**. You don't need any third-party software or device for this method. Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Tecno  device using your Google Account.

![Tecno Pova 5 Pro  lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-02.jpg)

- Enter a random password or PIN on your phone's lock screen five times.
- Wait for the system to give the alert message after you enter the wrong password five times.
- Now, wait for 30 seconds until the system asks you to enter your lock screen password.
- At the bottom left corner, tap the “Forgotten Password” option.
- Now the system will ask for your Google account and password.
- After you verify your Google account, you can enter your device.

### 3: Answer Security Questions

If you want to unlock your Tecno  phone, you can also answer some security questions and reset the password. This method does not work on all Tecno  devices, but you can use it for **Tecno Pova 5 Pro  screen unlock without PC**. You will see various questions if your Google account is linked with the Tecno Pova 5 Pro device. All questions are based on your profile and credentials. You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock Tecno Pova 5 Pro  with security questions.

![Tecno Pova 5 Pro  forgot pattern interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-03.jpg)

- Use a random password or PIN five times and wait for the 30 seconds alert message.
- Tap on the “Forgot Pattern” option and move to the next screen.
- Select the “Answer Question” option if you want to unlock security questions. You can also select "Enter Google account details" if you know your Google account password.
- Tap on the “Next” button and answer every question that comes up.
- If you give correct answers, the system will open the screen lock.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Tecno Pova 5 Pro  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Tecno Pova 5 Pro  with the power button.

![power key](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-04.jpg)

- Press and hold the Volume down + Power buttons together for a few seconds. Hold the keys until you see the Tecno  logo on the screen.

![volume down and power key](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-05.jpg)

- Select the Language using the volume keys to navigate and the power key to select.

![select device language](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-06.jpg)

![recovery mode menu](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-07.jpg)
