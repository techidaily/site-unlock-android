## 5\. RainbowCrack : New Innovation in Password Hash Cracker

RainbowCrack software uses rainbow tables to crack hashes, in other words we can say it uses process of a large-scale time-memory trade for effective and fast password cracking.

Large-scale-time-memory-trade-off is a process of computing all hashes and plain text using a selected hash algorithm. After calculations, obtained results are stored in the tables called rainbow table. Process of creating rainbow tables is very time consuming but when its done software works very fast.

Password cracking using rainbow table is faster than the normal brute force attack method. It’s available for Linux and Windows operating system.
