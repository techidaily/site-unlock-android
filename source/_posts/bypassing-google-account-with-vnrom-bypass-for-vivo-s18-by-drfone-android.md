It is imperative to understand that unlocking your Vivo S18  Phone using a Gmail ID and password should be your last resort and especially if you are using an older version of Android.

Once you get that, it will trigger the “Forget Password/Pattern” option on Your Vivo S18. This way, you can sneak back into the system once again.
