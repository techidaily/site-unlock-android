## Part 1: Lock System About Honor 100 Pro  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Honor 100 Pro  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Honor 100 Pro  is one of the older versions of Honor  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Honor 100 Pro  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Honor 100 Pro  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Honor 100 Pro  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Honor 100 Pro  with Find My Device.

Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Honor  device using your Google Account.

![Honor 100 Pro  lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-02.jpg)

This method does not work on all Honor  devices, but you can use it for **Honor 100 Pro  screen unlock without PC**.

You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock Honor 100 Pro  with security questions.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Honor 100 Pro  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Honor 100 Pro  with the power button.
