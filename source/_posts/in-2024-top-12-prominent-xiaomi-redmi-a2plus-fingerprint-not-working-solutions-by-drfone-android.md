### 3\. Outdated Firmware

#### Problem

An outdated operating system or firmware can lead to compatibility issues. This can lead to malfunctioning features like the **Pixel 6A fingerprint sensor not working**.

#### Solution: Check for Updates

The best way to resolve this issue is to update your Pixel device. Having an outdated version of Android OS can lead to an accumulation of bugs and glitches.

Accumulated dirt, dust, or residue on the phone or fingerprint sensor can cause obstruction. This can lead to the failure to properly recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone

Employ a gentle, dry microfiber cloth for wiping down the complete surface of your Pixel device. Take particular care to thoroughly clean the region surrounding the fingerprint sensor.

## Part 1: Ways That Xiaomi Lets You Unlock Your Xiaomi Redmi A2+

Xiaomi Redmi A2+  are more than just smartphones; they are gateways to a personalized and secure user experience. To access the myriad of features these devices offer, Google provides several unlocking methods, ensuring both convenience and security. Here are these options:

Setting up a PIN is straightforward via the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device’s security settings, and unlocking your phone is as easy as tapping in the correct sequence of numbers.
- Similar to a PIN but potentially more secure due to the allowance of a longer combination of numbers and letters. A passcode is ideal for those who seek an extra layer of security. You set it up in the security settings and use it to unlock your phone just like a PIN but with the added complexity of alphanumeric characters.
- **Face Unlock.Pixel’s Face Unlock** uses advanced facial recognition software. It scans your face to grant access, offering a hands-free and quick way to unlock your Pixel. This feature can be activated in the security settings and requires a simple glance at your phone to unlock.

![woman holding a Xiaomi Redmi A2+  ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/google-pixel-7-unlock-02.jpg)

- [**<u><b>Fingerprint Unlock</b></u>**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/google-pixel-frp-bypass.html)**.** This method uses your unique fingerprint as a key. It’s fast, secure, and convenient. The Pixel 6a, 6, and 7 fingerprint scanners are actually under the display. Register your fingerprint in the settings, then touch the sensor to gain access.
- **Pattern**. If you prefer a more visual method, the [<u>pattern lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mi-pattern-lock.html)lets you draw a specific shape or pattern on the screen to unlock your phone. It’s a fun and interactive way to secure your device. Create your pattern in the security settings, and unlock your phone by replicating it on the lock screen.

In essence, each unlocking method offered by the Xiaomi Redmi A2+  provides a blend of security and ease. Whichever unlocking method you prefer, Google ensures that accessing your phone is secure and convenient.

### Method 2: Entering Into Safe Mode

Safe Mode is a diagnostic mode in Android that can help bypass third-party lock screen apps. It’s useful if you’ve used a third-party app for your lock screen.

To do this, press the power button, then long-press on the **Power off** option. Tap **OK** when **Reboot to safe mode** option appears. In Safe Mode, third-party apps are disabled. Thus, you can now access your device if a third-party app is causing lock issues.

### Method 3: Force Resetting a Device/Flashing a New ROM

Force resetting or flashing a new ROM can be considered a last resort. They involve erasing all data on your device or installing a new operating system.

- **Force resetting your device**. To force reset your Xiaomi, press and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously to enter recovery mode. Use the volume buttons to navigate to **Wipe data/factory reset**and select it with the power button. This will get rid of existing password locks.
- **Flashing a new ROM**. This is more complex and typically requires downloading a new firmware and flashing tool. It’s only recommended for advanced users or as a last resort.

Remember, while these methods can effectively unlock your device, they also come with risks. Always [<u>back up your data regularly</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup/android-backup-software.html), and use these methods responsibly, considering their potential to erase your data or affect your device’s warranty.

## Bonus: How To Perform a SIM Unlock on Xiaomi

[<u>Unlocking the SIM </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/android-sim-unlock-code-generator.html) on your Xiaomi, particularly the Xiaomi Redmi A2+  , opens up a world of flexibility, especially for those who frequently travel or wish to switch carriers. This process can be accomplished for free through your carrier, provided certain conditions are met. Dive into the steps and considerations for performing a SIM unlock on your Xiaomi.

### Understanding the Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the SIM unlock, ensure you’re in good standing with your carrier. This means:

- No outstanding bills.
- Your contract for the phone has expired.
- The device has been in your possession for at least 60-90 days.

Different carriers have varying requirements for a SIM unlock, so your first move should be to contact them for specific details.

### Steps for SIM Unlock Through Your Carrier

Here are the steps to SIM **unlock your Xiaomi Redmi A2+**,These generally involve the following steps but are still subject to the official instructions of your carrier:

![sim and unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/%20google-pixel-7-unlock-10.jpg)

- **Step 1:** Open the Phone app and dial \*#06# on your Xiaomi. This will display your phone’s IMEI number. Note this number down for future reference.
- **Step 2:** Call your carrier and request a SIM unlock code. You’ll likely need to provide your Xiaomi’s IMEI number.
- **Step 3:** If you meet your carrier’s requirements, they will email you the SIM unlock code within 2-5 days.
- **Step 4:** Once you receive the code, replace your current SIM with one from a different carrier. When prompted, enter the SIM unlock code you received via email.

### Alternative Method: Android SIM Unlock

If your carrier cannot unlock your Xiaomi Redmi A2+  ’s SIM, or if you prefer a quicker solution, consider using network unlocking services. This may be websites like UnlockBase, Mobile Unlocks, etc.

This generally involves the following steps:

- **Step 1**: Like the previous method, retrieve your IMEI number by dialing \*#06# on your Pixel.
- **Step 2:** Go to the Android SIM unlock provider’s website and enter your device’s IMEI number.
- **Step 3:** Follow through with the checkout process, providing payment and contact information.
- **Step 4:** Once the payment is processed, you’ll receive the unlock code via SMS or email. Insert a SIM from a different carrier into your Pixel, then enter the received [<u>unlock code</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-unlock-codes.html) when prompted.

By following these steps, you can successfully unlock the SIM of your Xiaomi device, ensuring you can enjoy your phone with the carrier of your choice, wherever your travels may take you.

### Important Considerations

Remember, unlocking the SIM doesn’t absolve you from your carrier contract. You’re still obligated to make timely payments as per your agreement. The primary advantage of unlocking your SIM is the freedom to use your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ with any carrier’s SIM card, offering greater flexibility and control over your mobile experience. Thus, it is encouraged not to do anything illegal to avoid future complications.
