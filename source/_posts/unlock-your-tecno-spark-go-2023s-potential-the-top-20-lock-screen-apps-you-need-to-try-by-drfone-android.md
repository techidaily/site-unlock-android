## How To Easily Unlock Tecno Screen?

If you've ever had a Tecno phone, then you know that their screens are locked by default. It can be a pain if you want to access your messages or change your background image quickly.

So don't wait any longer - read on for instructions on how to unlock the Tecno phone pin code.

Like most people, you probably lock your Tecno phone as soon as you turn it on. It's a good way to keep your phone safe from prying eyes and accidental button presses. But what happens when you forget your phone's passcode? Or worse, what if your phone gets locked by a malicious app?

There are a few different ways to unlock your Tecno phone. We'll show you how to do it.

## Method 1. Google Find My Device (Without Password/Pin/Pattern)

If you're like me, you've probably tried a million different ways to unlock your Tecno phone, only to be frustrated by the results. Luckily, there's an easy way to unlock your Tecno phone using Google's Find My Device feature.

Google will use your location, phone information, and connection log to find your Nokia.

Follow these steps to unlock the Tecno lock screen password without losing data:

- **Step 1**: Sign into your Google account and navigate the Find My Device website.

![google find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/unlock-nokia-screen-2.jpg)

- **Step 2**: Sign in with your Google account, which you used on your locked Tecno phone.

- **Step 4**: Simply click on "Lock".
- **Step 5**: Enter a password that is not your Google account password in the "New Password" field.
- **Step 6**: Type the new password in the "Confirm password" field. This password lock will replace the current lock screen.
- **Step 7**: You can leave the "Recovery message" field empty or type anything in it.
- **Step 8**: Enter another phone number in the "Phone number" field, although this is optional.
- **Step 9**: Choose "Lock" after entering your password and filling out the optional fields if you wish.
- **Step 10**: If the process is successful, you will receive the unlock code within a few seconds.
- **Step 11**: Navigate to the "Screen Settings" menu after unlocking your device.
- **Step 12**: Use a new password; you can use the temporary password if you want.
