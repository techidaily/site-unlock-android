## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Infinix Note 30 Pro 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Infinix Note 30 Pro device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.
