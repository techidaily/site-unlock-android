## Part 4: Turn On Smart Lock For Android With Trusted Face

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555207782388.jpg)

The feature recognizes your face and then unlocks the Vivo V30 Pro device. Once you set up the Vivo V30 Pro device to recognize your face as a trusted face, it will unlock the Vivo V30 Pro device as soon as it recognizes you.

PRECAUTION:Â  At best, this can be the first level of security, as one who resembles you to some extent can unlock the Vivo V30 Pro device. Photographs are not stored in the system. The device does hold necessary data to recognize your face, and the security level is determined by how good the Vivo V30 Pro device is configured. The data is not accessed by any app or loaded onto a Google server for backup.

_Setting Up Trusted Face_

- â¢ Go to Smart Lock and tap Trusted Face.
- â¢ Tap on Setup. Follow on-screen instructions.

The device begins to gather data about your face. The trusted face icon appears. As a backup, in case Smart Lock does not recognize your face, use the manual system by applying the PIN or password to unlock the Vivo V30 Pro device.

In case Trusted Face is not required, tap on reset Trusted Face appearing under the Trusted Face menu. Tap on Reset to reset the option.

- â¢ If you feel facial recognition is not up to the mark, go to Smart Lock and tap on a Trusted face.
- â¢ Tap on Improve face matching.
- â¢ Tap on Next and follow instructions on the screen to complete the task.

Smart Lock Android is a great feature and is only going to improve on time. With added security measures being introduced by Google for Bluetooth and NFC unlock android devices, including configuration to Google maps and Gmail, the feature may be one of the most important features to overcome constant blocking of devices even in protected places.
