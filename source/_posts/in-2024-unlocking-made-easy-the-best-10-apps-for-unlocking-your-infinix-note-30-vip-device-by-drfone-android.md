## 2.Lok Lok

Lok Lok has a unique take on the locking screen application niche, allowing you to send drawings to people who use the same application. It has the basic functions of course but it really is only fan when others you know, use the same app as well. This fact kind of restricts this otherwise excellent application but the idea is genius. An Android unlock screen app that allows your creative side to shine through.

This Android unlock app doesn't allow pin lock screen at the moment, it can be unlocked with the home button

The home screen will highlight notifications for which it will offer two options, either you swipe down in which case you will ignore the notification, or swipe anywhere else and the lock screen will unlock. What's really great about this Android unlock app is the fact that it can use your device's sensors, allowing it to detect its placement therefore whether or not it should be on or off.
