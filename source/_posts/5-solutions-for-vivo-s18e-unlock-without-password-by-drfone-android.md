### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Vivo S18e  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Vivo S18e  with its privacy password settings.

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Vivo S18e  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Vivo S18e  with Find My Device.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Vivo S18e ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Vivo S18e device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Vivo S18e  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Vivo S18e :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Vivo S18e  device.

It might be helpful if you discover that your device is functioning strangely. Recovery Mode Android technically refers to a unique bootable partition with a recovery application installed inside it.

However, users can also use it to reset the android password if it is forgotten. The instructions for resetting android devices through recovery mode are different for every android device.

### 3\. Forgot Password Feature (Android 4.4 and Lower)

In case you lose your pattern, PIN, or other passwords, older versions of Android, including Android 4.4 KitKat, have an integrated feature to let you continue using your device.

Enter an erroneous pattern or PIN five times on the lock screen to reveal this function. A button with the words "Forgot pattern," "Forgot PIN," or "Forgot password" will show up. Tap it. The username and password for the Google account connected to your Android smartphone will be required.

### 4\. Using ADB

Launch Recovery mode and restart the phone. Turn off your phone. Then to access the Bootloader, simultaneously press the Power button and the Volume Down key. Then select Recovery mode.

Use USB to connect the phone. You must have ADB set up on your computer. (ADB is part of the Android Developer Bundle)

Use the shell's following command to start

Rm /data/system/gesture.key using the adb shell

Turn the phone back on normally. Any pattern will unlock the screen, and you will be prompted to enter one.

## Bonus Method: Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock

On most Android handsets, you can attempt Dr.Fone to unlock the screen lock easily. It allows you to delete the password, PIN, pattern, and fingerprint from an Android phone.
