The feature recognizes your face and then unlocks the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device. Once you set up the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device to recognize your face as a trusted face, it will unlock the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device as soon as it recognizes you.

PRECAUTION:  At best, this can be the first level of security, as one who resembles you to some extent can unlock the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device. Photographs are not stored in the system. The device does hold necessary data to recognize your face, and the security level is determined by how good the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device is configured. The data is not accessed by any app or loaded onto a Google server for backup.
