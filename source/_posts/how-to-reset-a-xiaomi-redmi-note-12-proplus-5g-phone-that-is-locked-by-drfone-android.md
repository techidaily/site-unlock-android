## Forgot Pattern Lock? Here's How You Can Unlock Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G Pattern Lock Screen

Forgetting the pattern lock of a device and getting locked out of it is probably one of the most frustrating scenarios faced by Android users. Nevertheless, unlike popular operating systems, Android provides a seamless way to past the forgot pattern lock feature.
