Below are the two most common problems faced by Android users during their efforts to disable the feature of screen lock.

**1\. In the Screen Security choice, the None bar can not be chosen.**

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Infinix Note 30 5G ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Infinix Note 30 5G device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Infinix Note 30 5G  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Infinix Note 30 5G :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code â\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*â on your device, tap âService Infoâ and select âSIM Lock.â

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your deviceâs IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Infinix Note 30 5G  device.
