![Minimal adb and fastboot installation complete](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313566582.jpg)

**Step 4.** Make sure your device is connected, then go to the Minimal ADB and Fastboot installation directory.

This PC \[Win 8& 10\] or My computer \[Windows 7 & below\]> Local Disk (C:) \[primary drive\]> Program Files \[for 32-bit\] or Program Files (x86) \[for 64-bit\] > Minimal ADB and Fasboot.

![Program Files (x86) folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313591963.jpg)

- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_

## Method 3: Factory Reset Infinix Hot 30 5G  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Infinix Hot 30 5G  phone to allow users to erase the Infinix Hot 30 5G device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box. Naturally, this is not a preferred way, as it requires the phone to be set up all over again and that takes time. Also, all data will need to be backed up beforehand in order to restore it again. Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Infinix Hot 30 5G  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Infinix Hot 30 5G device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Infinix Hot 30 5G device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

This is how to disable screen lock on Android:

**Step 1:** Navigate to Settings > Security > Screen Lock.

**Step 2:** Enter the PIN or pattern.

**Step 3:** Choose None and confirm.
