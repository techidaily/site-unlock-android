## Part 2: How to unlock Android password without factory reset using Android Device Manager?

With very simple steps and a few minutes at hand, you can get rid of your password using Android Device Manager (ADM). This tool will unlock your password without going for a factory reset and losing data. The main feature of the Android device manager will run through the Google account. The installation of a Google account is very important to run out the Android device manager. The Android device will respond immediately once if the phone is switched on. The connectivity of the internet is a must to find the map on the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device. How to unlock Android phone passwords without factory reset? May it be quite interesting to use device manager visuals? The steps are mentioned below:

**Step 1.** Your Android phone is always linked to your Google account. So first and foremost, on your computer or on another mobile phone, open the site <www.google.com/Android/devicemanager>.

![log in android device manager](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15090637241780.jpg)

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15090637463876.jpg)

**Step 2.** Here you will see three options: “Ring,” “Lock,” and “Erase.” Select the “Lock” option

**Step 3.** A window will appear where you need to type any temporary password. Do not enter your Google password, and you need not enter the recovery message. Click on “Lock ” again.

![enter temporary password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15090638114424.jpg)

Once successful, you will get a confirmation message below the three buttons: Ring, Lock, and the Erase option.

**Step 4.** On your locked phone, you will see a field asking for your password. Here you can enter your temporary password. Doing so will unlock your device.

**Step 5.** Now in your unlocked phone, go to Settings and then to Security. Now click on disable to remove the temporary password, and later you change it with a new one.

You have successfully unlocked your device.

## Part 3: Unlock Android password using custom recovery and Pattern Password Disable (SD card needed)?

The third way to unlock an Android phone password without a factory reset it using the “custom recovery” technique. To work out this process, you would have to install the custom recovery process. Also, your phone needs to have an SD card. It will be required to send the zip file to the phone since your device is locked. This technique requires access to the Android System folder and rooting your device if not already rooted.

Custom recovery is a usual mechanism in all smartphones. It predicts the troubleshooting techniques and how to process the main configuration with all sequences. Quite interesting, isn’t it?

Follow the following steps to complete and unlock the Android password without a factory reset.

- **Step 1.** First of all, download a zip file by the name [“Pattern Password Disable”](https://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=2532214&d=1390399283) to the computer system and then transfer it to your SD card.
- **Step 2.** Then you would need to insert the SD card into your locked phone and then restart the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device in recovery mode.
- **Step 3.** Next, move on to flash on the zip files to the card and restart. After that, your phone will boot and open up without the locked screen.

_**Note**: Sometimes, the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device may ask for a pattern or password. You just need to put in any random pattern/password then it will get unlocked._

Through this easy method, you can now access your Android phone without using a factory reset and losing your valuable data.

The problem of getting your mobile locked and not being able to open it is a common problem on Android phones these days. Many of us tend to panic when such problems arise. However, now that we have given some easy solutions and methods to unlock Android phone passwords without factory reset and losing any data, things would be much easier. Thus, you will solve your problems in no time.
