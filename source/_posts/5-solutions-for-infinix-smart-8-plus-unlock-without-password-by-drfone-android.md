## Part 1: Lock System About Infinix Smart 8 Plus  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Infinix Smart 8 Plus  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Infinix Smart 8 Plus  is one of the older versions of Infinix  android phones that was released in 2016.

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Infinix Smart 8 Plus  with Find My Device.

Here are the steps for **Infinix Smart 8 Plus  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.
