- **Step 2.** Choose “Wipe Data/Factory Reset.” You can use the Volume up and down key to navigate the options and the power/home key to select anything.

Before proceeding, make sure that you have ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed on your computer. If you don't have it, then you can download Android SDK right [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).
