## Method 1: Unlock Vivo S18e  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern.

So, if you have an old Vivo S18e  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Vivo S18e  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Vivo S18e  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

There are certain apps that may require to be locked more than others. Of course the choice of which apps you should lock will depend on your own uses and preferences. The following are some of the apps you would like to lock for one reason or another.

### 1\. The Messaging App

This is the application that allows you to send and receive messages. You may want to lock this app if you use your device to send messages of a sensitive nature that you would rather keep private. You may also want to lock this app if your device is used by more than one person and you don’t want other users reading your messages.

### 2\. Email App

Most people use individual email applications such as Yahoo Mail App or Gmail. This is another critical one if you are going to protect your work emails. You may want to lock the email app if your work emails are sensitive in nature and contain information that is not for all individuals.

### 3\. Google Play Services

This is the application that allows you to download and install applications to your device. You may want to lock this one if you are trying to prevent other users from downloading and installing further apps to your device. This is especially valuable if your device is utilized by children.

### 4\. Gallery App

The Gallery app displays all the images on your device. The main reason you may want to lock the Gallery app may be because you have sensitive images that are not suitable for all viewers. Again this is ideal if children make use of your device and you have images that you would rather they didn’t see.

### 5\. Music Pla\_x\_yer App

This is the Application that you use to play the music on your device. You may want to lock it if you don’t want anyone else making changes to your saved audio files and playlists or don’t want someone listening to your audio files.

### 6\. File Manager App

This is the App that displays all of the files that are saved on your device. It is the ultimate app to lock if you have sensitive information on your device that you would rather not share. Locking this app will ensure that all of the files on your device will remain safe from prying eyes.

Having the ability to lock your Apps is an easy way to keep information out of the limelight. It also allows you to take full control of your device. Try it, it might just be freeing as opposed to locking your entire device.
