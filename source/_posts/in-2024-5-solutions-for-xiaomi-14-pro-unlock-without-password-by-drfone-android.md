## Part 1: Lock System About Xiaomi 14 Pro  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Xiaomi 14 Pro  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Xiaomi 14 Pro  is one of the older versions of Xiaomi  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Xiaomi 14 Pro  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Xiaomi 14 Pro  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Xiaomi 14 Pro  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Xiaomi 14 Pro  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Xiaomi 14 Pro  with Find My Device.

Here are the steps for **Xiaomi 14 Pro  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Xiaomi 14 Pro  with the power button.
