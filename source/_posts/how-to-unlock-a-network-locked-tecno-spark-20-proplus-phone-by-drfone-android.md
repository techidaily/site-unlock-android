## How to Unlock a Network Locked Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ network unlock** solutions.
