## Part 1: Lock System About Itel A60  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Itel A60  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Itel A60  is one of the older versions of Itel  android phones that was released in 2016.

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Itel A60  with Find My Device.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools.

Here are the steps for **Itel A60  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Itel A60  with the power button.
