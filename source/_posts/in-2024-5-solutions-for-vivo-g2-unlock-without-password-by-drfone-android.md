Before we move towards the **Vivo G2  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Vivo G2  is one of the older versions of Vivo  android phones that was released in 2016.

You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Vivo G2  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Vivo G2  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Vivo G2  with Find My Device.

Here are the steps for **Vivo G2  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.
