Like most people, you probably lock your Itel phone as soon as you turn it on. It's a good way to keep your phone safe from prying eyes and accidental button presses. But what happens when you forget your phone's passcode? Or worse, what if your phone gets locked by a malicious app?

If you're like me, you've probably tried a million different ways to unlock your Itel phone, only to be frustrated by the results. Luckily, there's an easy way to unlock your Itel phone using Google's Find My Device feature.

Google will use your location, phone information, and connection log to find your Nokia.

Follow these steps to unlock the Itel lock screen password without losing data:

- **Step 1**: Sign into your Google account and navigate the Find My Device website.
