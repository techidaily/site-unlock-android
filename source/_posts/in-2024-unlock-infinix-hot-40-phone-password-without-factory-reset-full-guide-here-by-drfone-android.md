**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Infinix Hot 40  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

## Why does not Fingerprint Work
