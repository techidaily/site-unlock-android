## Part 1: Lock System About Itel A70  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Itel A70  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Itel A70  is one of the older versions of Itel  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Itel A70  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Itel A70  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Itel A70  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?

You can easily remove the lock screen of your Itel A70  if you remember your password or pattern.

- Go to “Settings” and follow the previous steps to open the "Lockscreen Password" settings.
- Disable the lock screen by tapping on the "Enable Lock Screen" button once.
- Enter your password or pattern and wait for the system to remove the screen lock.

## Part 2: 5 Solutions to Unlock Itel A70  Without Password or Pattern

### 1: Google Find My Device

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Itel A70  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Itel A70  with Find My Device.

![google find my device web home page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-01.jpg)

Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Itel  device using your Google Account.

![Itel A70  lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-02.jpg)

This method does not work on all Itel  devices, but you can use it for **Itel A70  screen unlock without PC**. You will see various questions if your Google account is linked with the Itel A70 device. All questions are based on your profile and credentials. You have to answer precisely with proper spaces.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Itel A70  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Itel A70  with the power button.
