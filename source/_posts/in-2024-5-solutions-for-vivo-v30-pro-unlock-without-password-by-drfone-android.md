## Part 1: Lock System About Vivo V30 Pro  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Vivo V30 Pro  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Vivo V30 Pro  is one of the older versions of Vivo  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Vivo V30 Pro  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Vivo V30 Pro  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Vivo V30 Pro  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Vivo V30 Pro  with Find My Device.
