The feature recognizes your face and then unlocks the Infinix Hot 30 5G device. Once you set up the Infinix Hot 30 5G device to recognize your face as a trusted face, it will unlock the Infinix Hot 30 5G device as soon as it recognizes you.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555208588486.jpg)

PRECAUTION:Â  At best, this can be the first level of security, as one who resembles you to some extent can unlock the Infinix Hot 30 5G device. Photographs are not stored in the system. The device does hold necessary data to recognize your face, and the security level is determined by how good the Infinix Hot 30 5G device is configured. The data is not accessed by any app or loaded onto a Google server for backup.

_Setting Up Trusted Face_

- â¢ Go to Smart Lock and tap Trusted Face.
- â¢ Tap on Setup. Follow on-screen instructions.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555210728317.jpg)

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555211623749.jpg)
