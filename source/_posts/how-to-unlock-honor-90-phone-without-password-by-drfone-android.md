You need to log into the Google account that is associated with the Honor 90 device, then do the following:

- The unlock pattern may only be used five times before a notification telling you to try again in 30 seconds appears.
- "Forgot pattern" will show up at the bottom of the screen.

- That's it; from this point forward, you may enter any new PIN or pattern that you can recall to unlock your smartphone.

### 2\. Google Find My Device

Using your Google account is a superb method for finding the Honor 90 device when lost or stolen.

In addition, it may be used to lock or ring your smartphone. You may have noticed that there are three options available when using this feature: "Ring," "Lock," and "Erase."

To bypass the Android lock screen, all you need to do is sign into the Honor 90 device's associated Google account and then follow these steps:

- On any Android device or a computer, go to <www.google.com/android/find> and sign in using your Google account. Choose the Android smartphone you wish to unlock after that.
- After choosing the Honor 90 device, select one of the three options, "lock," from the list.

- Press and hold the Volume Up and Side buttons simultaneously until you see the brand logo on the screen for Android devices without a Power/Bixby/Home button.

## Part 2: How to Unlock Honor 90  Bootloader

Honor 90  is the flagship device of HTC by all means. With a world of features and offerings, Honor 90  truly is a beast. While the phone is very powerful without any modifications, the true potential is yet to be seen and that can only be done if the bootloader is unlocked. So, to have a complete control over the Honor 90  device, it is important to unlock the bootloader and the process has to be carried out diligently. One of the initial things that needs to be ensured is that the Honor 90  device is fully charged or atleast 80% mark. Make sure you have the fastboot drivers for the Honor 90 device configured on the windows machine and the Android SDK. Here are some of the steps which can be followed to unlock bootloader.

Step 1: It is always very important to keep the phone data backed up and more so when you are planning to unlock the bootloader.

As one of the initial measures, backup the Honor 90 device completely as bootloader unlocking process will wipe all the data off. So, backup all the data like photos, contacts, multimedia files, documents, etc.

Step 4: Now, you will be presented with four steps to put the Honor 90 device in bootloader mode. Disconnect the Honor 90  device from the PC and turn the Honor 90 device off completely. Press the volume down button along with the power button to switch the Honor 90 device on in bootloader mode.

Step 7: In the command prompt window, type “fastboot devices” and press enter. Honor 90  will show up in the command prompt.

Note: The drivers have to be installed correctly to see the Honor 90 device in the command prompt. So, if the Honor 90 device does not show up, reinstall HTC Sync Manager and try again after restarting the computer.

Step 8: On HTC Dev’s website third page, click on “proceed to Step 9”. Follow the steps listed and then click on submit. The unlock token code for the Honor 90 device will be mailed by HTC. Download the token and name it “Unlock\_code.bin” and place the token in the fastboot folder.
