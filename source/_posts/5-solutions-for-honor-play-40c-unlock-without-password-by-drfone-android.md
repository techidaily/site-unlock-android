Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Honor Play 40C  with Find My Device.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization.

Here are the steps for **Honor Play 40C  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Honor Play 40C  with the power button.

Now, the question is, is it possible **to track an IMEI number through Google Earth**? This question has sparked much debate on the internet, so this article aims to find it out. Keep reading and learn the secrets of **Google Earth IMEI trackers**.

![google earth imei tracker](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-01.jpg)

## Part 1: How To Track Your Honor Play 40C on Google Earth

This **Google Maps IMEI number tracking** issue has caused quite a buzz and controversy on the internet. It has raised many concerns regarding the safety and privacy of every smartphone user. To tell you the truth, Google Earth lacks IMEI location data and does not provide such capabilities. Thus, there is no truth in **tracking IMEI numbers through Google Earth**.

However, if you have access to a cell phone's GPS coordinates or the location of a cell tower to which it is linked, you can use Google Earth to follow its location.

### How To Locate a Smartphone Using Google Earth

Many current smartphones include GPS receivers that allow them to pinpoint their exact location. If you know the phone's GPS coordinates, you can plug them into Google Earth to see where it is on the map.

- **Step 1:** This process won't be possible if your location services are not enabled on your phone. To do this, navigate to **Settings,** then **Location** on Android, and **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Location Services** on iOS.

![iphone location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-02.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Google Earth can be downloaded and installed on your computer or mobile device. It works with Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. Download it from your device's **Google Earth** website or the app store.

![install google earth android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-03.jpg)

Choose the Honor Play 40C device you want to track from the dropdown menu if you have numerous devices linked to the same account. The timeline displays the selected device's location history for the set date. Examine the locations visited, the routes taken, and the time spent at each spot. For further information, select a certain location or time.

![google maps location history](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-05.jpg)

**Note:** Google Earth does not support real-time location tracking by default. You can use the **Find My Device** function on Android or **Find My** on iOS instead if you want to track your phone's real-time location.

## Part 2: Google Earth Alternatives: Track Phone Using IMEI Number

Now that you know the truth behind **tracking an IMEI number through Google Earth**, let's talk about other ways to track your phone using your IMEI number. This section will discuss some of your other options when it comes to IMEI number location tracking.
