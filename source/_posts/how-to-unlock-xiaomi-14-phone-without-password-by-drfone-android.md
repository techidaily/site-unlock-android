## How To Unlock Xiaomi 14 Phone Without Password?

Has your Android smartphone been locked, and are you having trouble unlocking it now because you have forgotten phone password? Looking for methods to remove the password from your Android phone without doing a factory reset?

If the answer is "YES," you've come to the correct spot.

As a result, we have created some of the greatest guidelines or, you might say, top ways that may assist you in unlocking Android phones today, simply for you and countless other Android users.

## Part 1: Unlock Your Locked Screen Without Password By 6 Efficient Ways

### 1\. By your Google account

You can use your Google Account to unlock the Android phone password if, after several tries, you are still unable to do so without doing a factory reset.

You need to log into the Google account that is associated with the Xiaomi 14 device, then do the following:

- The unlock pattern may only be used five times before a notification telling you to try again in 30 seconds appears.
- "Forgot pattern" will show up at the bottom of the screen.

![unlock with security question](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-1.jpg)

- You must enter the Gmail account that is associated with the Xiaomi 14 device here before selecting "Next."

![answer the security question](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-2.jpg)

- That's it; from this point forward, you may enter any new PIN or pattern that you can recall to unlock your smartphone.

### 2\. Google Find My Device

Using your Google account is a superb method for finding the Xiaomi 14 device when lost or stolen.

In addition, it may be used to lock or ring your smartphone. You may have noticed that there are three options available when using this feature: "Ring," "Lock," and "Erase."

To bypass the Android lock screen, all you need to do is sign into the Xiaomi 14 device's associated Google account and then follow these steps:

- On any Android device or a computer, go to <www.google.com/android/find> and sign in using your Google account. Choose the Android smartphone you wish to unlock after that.
- After choosing the Xiaomi 14 device, select one of the three options, "lock," from the list.
- There will be a new pop-up window that you can use to change the Xiaomi 14 device password. Additionally, you can choose to add a phone number or recovery email.

![enter new password using google find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-3.jpg)

Many Samsung customers have this issue, which prevents them from using their devices. Try using the "Find My Mobile" feature on your mobile if you wish to unlock it if you're a Samsung user. It would be helpful if you had a Samsung or Android model account.

After that, use Find My Device to unlock your Android phone without losing any data by following the instructions below:

- Finally, just restart your smartphone and use it as normal.

### 4\. Hard reset (data loss)

Each brand has a unique method for hard resetting a locked Android device. The methods to factory reset locked Android devices from Samsung, LG, HTC, Sony, and Huawei are compiled here.

When your phone is locked, you may access the recovery menu of your phone using its physical keys and choose to hard reset the Xiaomi 14 device. Here's how to restore a locked phone to factory settings.

- Use the buttons to see the recovery menu.
- Press and hold the Volume Up and Side buttons simultaneously until you see the brand logo on the screen for Android devices without a Power/Bixby/Home button.

- Use the Volume Down key to highlight Wipe data/factory reset when the Android system recovery option displays, then hit the Power/Bixby key to choose it.
- Allow a few seconds for the factory reset procedure to finish after selecting Yes, or Factory data reset. The phone will reboot once you pick the Reboot system. Now you may configure it as if it were a brand-new gadget.

### 5\. Unlock from Forgot Pattern (android 4.4 or lower)

This is another choice that might assist you in unlocking your phone without a factory reset or password. You may have observed that when pattern lock was enabled on your device, a security PIN question was also prompted at that time.
