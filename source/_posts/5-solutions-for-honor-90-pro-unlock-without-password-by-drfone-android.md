Before we move towards the **Honor 90 Pro  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Honor 90 Pro  with its privacy password settings.

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Honor 90 Pro  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Honor 90 Pro  with Find My Device.
