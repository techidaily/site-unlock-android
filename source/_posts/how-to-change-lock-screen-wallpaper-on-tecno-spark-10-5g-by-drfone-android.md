## Part 2. Some Prominent Limitations of vnROM Bypass

**vnROM Bypass** offers a solution for bypassing FRP lock on certain Android devices. Yet, it comes with several notable limitations that necessitate exploring alternative options. The following are some of the limitations of vnROM Bypass:

### 1\. Limited Compatibility

vnROM Bypass primarily supports Android versions 5.0 to 8.1 (Lollipop to Oreo). Hence, it fails to function on devices operating on more recent Android versions. Android 9 through 14 users might encounter compatibility issues and inefficacy when utilizing this tool.

This tool has not received updates for some time, so its proper functionality cannot be guaranteed. It seems primarily compatible with older Android devices running on versions 5 through 8.1. Moreover, serious concerns exist about the tool's effectiveness, even for older devices.

### 4\. Complexity and Reliability Issues

The bypass process using vnROM Bypass can be complex. For users unfamiliar with such tools, it could lead to potential errors. The reliability of the tool's effectiveness varies across different devices and firmware versions. This results in inconsistent outcomes.
