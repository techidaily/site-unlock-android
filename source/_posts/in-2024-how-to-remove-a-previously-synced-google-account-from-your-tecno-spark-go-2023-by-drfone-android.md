This automation of device enrollment simplifies the setup process for both the IT department and the end-user.

![knox mobile enrolment page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-knox-enrollment-service-02.jpg)

## Part 2: How To Remove Knox Enrollment Service on Your Tecno Spark Go (2023)

In most cases, an administrator can only effectively **remove the Knox Enrollment Service** through the Samsung Knox Portal. This typically requires cooperation from your employer.

Hereâs a step-by-step guide to removing itfrom the Adminâs Portal:

- **Step 1:** Sign in to the Samsung Knox Portal using administrative credentials.
- **Step 2:** Navigate to **Samsung Knox Mobile Enrollment**, then click **Devices.**

### Rooting and Flashing a New ROM To Remove Knox Enrollment Service

This process involves gaining root access to the Tecno Spark Go (2023) deviceâs operating system, which allows you to modify the software extensively. After rooting, you can flash a new ROM that doesnât include the Knox software.

However, this method is risky and not recommended for the average user. It will void your warranty and potentially âbrickâ your device, rendering it unusable. Furthermore, this action could notify your employer of your attempt to remove Knox, which could have professional repercussions. Proceed with this method only if you know the risks and consequences.

**Removing Knox Enrollment Service** from your phone is feasible but requires careful consideration, especially in a corporate context. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions and understand the risks of modifying your deviceâs software.
