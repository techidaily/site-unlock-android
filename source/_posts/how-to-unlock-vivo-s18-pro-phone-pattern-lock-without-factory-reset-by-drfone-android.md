## Unlocking the Power of Smart Lock: A Beginner's Guide for Vivo S18 Pro Users

Google constantly comes up with features to simplify the way users interact and complete tasks on the Android platform. One of the most important features that techies loved to debate about was the Smart Lock Android, a secure password manager functioning in sync with a Google account on the Android phone.

## Part 1: What is Android Smart Lock?

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162221345.jpg)

Android Lollipop added a feature called Smart Lock, and the feature was devised as a smart tool to prevent the Android phone from locking once it was initially unlocked. In other words, the feature overrides an Android phone's Lock Screen feature, thereby saving users the need to enter passwords every time the Vivo S18 Pro device locks.

If you're at home, it's likely your android phone is locked out if you haven't accessed at for some time. Smart Locks solves the problem in many ways. It allows you to allocate trusted places. Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won't lock. Trusted devices come next. Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162911081.jpg)

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555165271526.jpg)

Finally, trusted face unlocking is the ultimate face recognition system that unlocks your Android device as soon as you look at it across the front-facing camera. A face unlock first introduced with Android Jelly Bean and has been significantly improved in later versions.

_Turning On Smart Lock_

The feature is enabled by first accessing settings. For example, in a Samsung Galaxy S6:

- • Here, you need to enter your Screen Lock. If you haven't done so, set up a password and PIN by following the on-screen prompts. The screen Lock is needed every time you have to change the Smart Lock settings.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555175242280.jpg)

Within Smart Lock, there are three options for setting the system. You can set up trusted devices, trusted face, and trusted places individually, combining two or all three at the same time. You can choose just one trusted face, but you have the option to set up as many trusted devices and trusted places as needed.

## How To Change Vivo S18 Pro Lock Screen Password?

Setting up a lock screen is a crucial step in protecting your phone's data. If you're not sure how to create one on your Android™ phone, we're here to help.

Your Android lock screen pin or password and your Google Account password are two passwords you use frequently. Keeping a good lock screen passcode is important.

Although you might not frequently enter your lock screen pin or password if you use a biometric unlocking method like fingerprint or facial recognition, it's still important to be familiar with it.

You'll need to reset your Google Account password if you forget it or become locked out for some other reason when you try to keep accessing all of your data. You might also need to change lock screen passcode from time to time.

![lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-change-lock-screen-password-1.jpg)


## How to Change/Set up Lock Screen Password

Select Screen Lock Type under Settings > Lock Screen. From there, you may select from a variety of lock screen options:

![how to set up password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-change-lock-screen-password-2.jpg)

**Swipe:** This lock type allows you to swipe in any direction on your screen to unlock your phone.

**Pattern:** If you opt to unlock your phone in this manner, you must create a pattern on a 3-by-3-dot grid.

**Pin:** A PIN lock is a four-digit code. Make sure you select a set of numbers that you can quickly recall.

**Password:** Your phone's highest level of security. Your password must be distinct, easily remembered, and include at least one letter and 7 characters.

Follow the setup instructions on-screen after selecting the security measure you prefer.

Additionally, you'll notice options to enable fingerprint or face biometric recognition features. Iris Scanner (S8/S8+) or Intelligent Scan (S9/S9+) may also be available on some older Samsung® models.

**Face recognition:** By holding your face directly in front of your phone's screen, you may unlock your phone and authenticate yourself in apps.

With fingerprints, you can quickly touch your finger to unlock your phone.

**Iris:** Check your eyes to make sure that only you can see the contents of your phone.

**Intelligent Scan:** A method of device unlocking that combines face and iris recognition technology.

Follow on-screen instructions if you decide to employ one of these sophisticated security technologies, or go to Settings > Biometrics and security for more customization choices.
