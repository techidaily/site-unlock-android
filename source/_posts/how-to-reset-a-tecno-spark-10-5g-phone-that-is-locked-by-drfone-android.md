You will be prompted to enter the current PIN in order to disable it. Key in the PIN and you will have successfully disabled the Lock screen PIN.

On the other hand, it is a nightmare if you forget screen lock and you don't know how to go about it. But at this moment, at least you have known a perfect way that you can remove screen lock without losing data on your Android phone.
