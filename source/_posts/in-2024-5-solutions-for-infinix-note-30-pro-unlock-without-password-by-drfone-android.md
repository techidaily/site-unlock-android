With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Infinix Note 30 Pro  with Find My Device.

Here are the steps for **Infinix Note 30 Pro  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Infinix Note 30 Pro  with the power button.
