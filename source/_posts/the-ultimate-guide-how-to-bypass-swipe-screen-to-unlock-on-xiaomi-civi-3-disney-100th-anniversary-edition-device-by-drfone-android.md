Please inspect the fingerprint module for any fluids or debris and clean it with a dry cloth to resolve this. If the dirt is on the module, clean it with wipes or a moist cloth wet with water.

### 2\. Software Update

Another software-related issue that may occur because " fingerprint sensor not working" issue is a software defect. Try checking if you have a pending update on your device and install it. Moreover, if the problem started after a system update, you may wait for a new update to fix the problem or go back to the previous update.

To install an update, open the Settings app, tap on 'System,' pick 'System Update,' and download and install any pending update.

### 3\. Clean your Screen

If you have a device with under-display fingerprint scanner, you might need to clean the screen properly before using the fingerprint. In some cases, screen protectors also interfere with fingerprint functioning.
