## Method 1: Unlock Vivo Y100 5G  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern.

So, if you have an old Vivo Y100 5G  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Vivo Y100 5G  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Vivo Y100 5G  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:
