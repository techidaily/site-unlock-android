### Method 2: Using “Forgot PIN/Passcode” and Google Account

You can use the **Forgot PIN/Passcode** feature if you’ve linked your phone to a Google account. After multiple failed attempts to unlock your phone, you’ll see a prompt to reset the password via your Google account credentials.

### Method 3: Forcing a Data Reset on Your Android Phone

As a last resort, you can [<u>perform a factory reset</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-factory-reset-huawei-phone-when-locked.html). This will erase all data on your device but remove the lock screen. Access the recovery mode by pressing a combination of keys (usually volume up/down and the power button) and then selecting **Wipe data/Factory reset**.

### Method 4: Booting Into Safe Mode

Booting into safe mode can bypass third-party lock screens. This method won’t work on the default lock screen but can be helpful if an app sets the lock.

In summary, while the emergency call bypass is a thing of the past, there are still various ways to unlock your phone. There’s always a solution, whether through a sophisticated tool like Wondershare Dr.Fone or built-in Android features.
