_Using the Android Device Manager to track a lost phone_


## Part 1: What is Android Device Manager lock?

Android Device Manager is Googleâs take on Appleâs Find My iPhone. Enabling the ADM is quite easy; just go to google.com/android/devicemanager Â on your computer and search through your list of devices that are already connected to your Google account. Once you are there, you can easily send a notification to the phone you want to enable remote password application and wiping upon.

ADM comes with a set of features that helps you to unlock your Android phone as well. It not only helps you to find your device, but also Ring it, lock it, and wipe and erase all the data as well, if your phone is lost or stolen. Once youâre logged into the ADM website from your computer, you can avail all these options once your phone is located. It is a wise option to get your device locked by Android Device Manager in case it is lost or stolen, so that your phone is secured.

Android Device Manager can unlock your phone under a specific set of circumstances only.

- â¢ First of all, Android Device Manager needs to be enabled on your phone before it is lost, stolen, etc.
- â¢ Secondly, your phone can only be tracked by ADM if the GPS option is switched on.
- â¢ Thirdly, the Xiaomi Redmi K70E device you are using for ADM, must be connected to Wi-Fi or internet, to login to your Google account.
- â¢ Lastly, Android Device Manager is not compatible for all Android versions. For now, it is only compatible with devices running Android 4.4 and above, so your phone must be in this category for ADM to work.

## Part 2: How to unlock Android phone with Android Device Manager?

1\. On your computer or any other mobile phone, visit: google.com/android/devicemanager

![unlock with android device manager](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15077981723179.jpg)

The Android Device Manager has successfully unlocked your phone!

A downside to this process, is an error message faced by some users while using ADM. Many users have reported the issue, that when they have tried using ADM to unlock their locked device, an error message has occurred, saying, âsince Google has verified that a screen lock is already setâ. Basically, this error message conveys that you will not be able to unlock your phone using Android Device Manager, and this is a flaw on Googleâs part, not your phoneâs.

## Part 3: What to do if phone is locked by Android Device Manager

There are 2 situations where you would want to know how to unlock the Android Device Manager lock â one, when you have unfortunately forgotten the screen lock passcode and the other is when your phone is locked by Android Device Manager.
