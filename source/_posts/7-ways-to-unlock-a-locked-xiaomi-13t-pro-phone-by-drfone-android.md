One of the most important features that techies loved to debate about was the Smart Lock Android, a secure password manager functioning in sync with a Google account on the Android phone.

## Part 1: What is Android Smart Lock?

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162221345.jpg)

Android Lollipop added a feature called Smart Lock, and the feature was devised as a smart tool to prevent the Android phone from locking once it was initially unlocked. In other words, the feature overrides an Android phone's Lock Screen feature, thereby saving users the need to enter passwords every time the Xiaomi 13T Pro device locks.

If you're at home, it's likely your android phone is locked out if you haven't accessed at for some time. Smart Locks solves the problem in many ways. It allows you to allocate trusted places. Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won't lock. Trusted devices come next. Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555165271526.jpg)

## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Xiaomi 13T Pro 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Xiaomi 13T Pro device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like **RootJunky** can help you [<u>bypass FRP Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

You can complete this process using the app by connecting your phone to a computer through an OTG cable. **RootJunky** can be helpfu l if you’ve forgotten your Google account password or bought a second-hand phone locked to someone else’s account. However, only use it if you have legitimate reasons to bypass FRP lock, like accessing your device after forgetting your Google account details.

![rootjunky logo](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/rootjunky-02.jpg)

Downloading the **RootJunky FRP** bypass tool from unofficial sources can introduce malware risks, so stick to trusted sources like the official website. Additionally, when exploring RootJunky, it is vital to keep the following in mind:
