You can unlock your Vivo S18  phone with Google Account in the following two ways:

Almost all Android smartphones, including Vivo S18 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Vivo S18 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider.
