Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern.

**Step 2:** Next, choose the option to reset the pattern by answering your Google credentials.

**Step 3:** Sign into the Google account that matches with the Google account on the phone.

**Step 4:** Lastly, create a new pattern to unlock your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G  phone.

This is how to disable screen lock on Android:

**Step 1:** Navigate to Settings > Security > Screen Lock.
