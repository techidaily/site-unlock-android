There are really just a few Apps on your Android device that have sensitive information you don’t want others getting access to.

With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Itel P40  with Find My Device.

Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Itel  device using your Google Account.

Here are the steps for **Itel P40  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Itel P40  with the power button.
