### 2\. Google Find My Device

Using your Google account is a superb method for finding the Infinix Note 30i device when lost or stolen.

In addition, it may be used to lock or ring your smartphone. You may have noticed that there are three options available when using this feature: "Ring," "Lock," and "Erase."
