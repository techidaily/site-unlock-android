## Top 10 Password Cracking Tools For Infinix Note 30

Password cracking process involves recovering a password from storage locations or from data, transmitted by a computer system on network. Password cracking term refers to group of techniques used to get password from a data system.

Purpose and reason of password cracking includes gaining an unauthorized access to a computer system or it can be recovery of forgotten password. There might be another reason of using password cracking technique that is for testing password strength so hacker could not hack into system.

Password cracking is normally performed thought repetitive process in which computer applies different combinations of password till the exact match.

**Brute Force Password Cracking:**

Term brute force password cracking may also be referred as brute force attack. Brute force password cracking is respective process of guessing password, in this process software or tool creates a large number of password combinations. Basically it’s a trail-and-error technique used by software to obtain password information from system.

A brute force attack are normally used by hackers when there is no chance of taking advantage of encrypted system weakness or by security analysis experts to test an organization’s network security .This method of password cracking is very fast for short length passwords but for long length passwords [dictionary attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack) technique is normally used.

Time taken by brute force password cracking software to crack password is normally depend upon speed of system and internet connection.

**GPU Password Cracking:**

[GPU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) is graphics processing unit, sometimes also called visual processing unit. Before talking about GPU password cracking we must have some understanding about [hashes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function). When user enter password the password information stored in form of computer hashes using the one-way hashing algorithm.

In this password cracking technique using GPU software take a password guess and look through hashing algorithm and compare it or match it with the existing hashes till the exact match.

GPU can perform mathematical functions in parallel as GPU have hundreds of core that gives massive advantage in cracking password. GPU is much faster than CPU so that’s the reason of using GPU instead of CPU.

**CUDA Password Cracking:**

[CUDA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) Compute Unified Device Architecture is a model for programming and a platform that perform computations in parallel, created by NVIDIA for graphic processing.

CUDA Password cracking includes cracking passwords using Graphics card which have GPU chip, GPU can perform mathematical functions in parallel so the speed of cracking password is faster than CPU.GPU have many 32bit chips on it that perform this operation very quickly.
