## Method 1: Unlock Vivo V30  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern.

So, if you have an old Vivo V30  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Vivo V30  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Vivo V30  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

There is a standard factory reset built into every Vivo V30  phone to allow users to erase the Vivo V30 device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

**Step 5:** Click Erase Device and confirm.

**Step 6:** After the erasure, your device will need to be set up all over again.

## Method 5: Request Service Provider To Unlock Your Vivo V30  Phone

You can request your service provider to unlock your Vivo V30  phone provided their conditions are met. Usually, they will be happy to oblige if there are no dues and the service period is over.

## Bonus Tip: If You Want To Disable Screen Lock

Sometimes, you may not need to secure your device at all. For example, if you have an old device that you want to use as a media player in your car or to give to children to play games, you may not want to password-protect the Vivo V30 device. This is how to disable screen lock on Android:

**Step 2:** Enter the PIN or pattern.

**Step 3:** Choose None and confirm.
