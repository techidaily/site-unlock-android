Android has undergone numerous changes to enhance user experience and security. One notable feature that was once present was the ability to **unlock phones with voice Google Assistant**. However, Google Assistant has removed this feature across all versions since 2021.

While this voice-unlocking feature is no longer available, there are still many things you can do with Google Assistant, even when the Itel P40+ device is locked. This tool brings an added layer of convenience to your smartphone experience.

Let's dig deeper into how you can **use Google Assistant on the lock screen** and make the most out of this tool in the following article.

![How to use Google Assistant](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-phone-with-voice-google-assistant-1.jpg)

## Part 1. What You Can Do With Voice Google Assistant

Google Assistant is a virtual assistant powered by artificial intelligence (AI) developed by tech giant Google. This application is readily available on most recent mobile phone models, especially those operating on Android 6.0 and newer versions.

Although you can no longer use the **Google Assistant unlock** feature, you can still perform a myriad of tasks using Google Assistant. These include:

- Getting the weather
- Setting alarms
- Playing music
- Sending texts
- Making a call
- Asking Google for information, etc.

### Enable Google Assistant on Lock Screen: A Step-by-Step Guide

- **Step 1:** Open Google Assistant:

Look for "Google Assistant" and open the app.

- **Step 2:** Ask Google Assistant to open the settings.

You can ask, "Hey Google, open the Google Assistant settings," and it will show you the Google Assistant settings.

## Part 2. How To Use Google Assistant on Lock Screen

After you've successfully enabled Google Assistant on your lock screen, let's see how to use Google Assistant to do certain tasks more efficiently and hands-free.

- **Step 1:** Wake Up Google Assistant

Start by waking up Google Assistant. You can do this by saying the wake word "Hey Google" or "OK Google." If it doesn’t work, you can long-press the home button or use any dedicated gesture to activate Google Assistant.

- **Step 2:** Issue a Voice Command

Once Google Assistant is active, issue a voice command related to the task you want to perform. For example:

"Hey Google, what's the weather today?"

"OK Google, set an alarm for 5 PM."

"Hey Google, play my Spotify playlist."

When you can still **unlock with Google Assistant**, you can ask it to “unlock my phone” or use any similar command.

## Part 3. Common Problems When Using Google Assistant

Unable to use **Google Assistant to unlock phone** is not the only drawback that users may have encountered in recent changes. Although Google Assistant on the lock screen presents a revolutionary way to interact with your phone, like any technology, it also comes with its share of challenges. Some of the common problems when using Google Assistant are:

1. **Misunderstandings and misinterpretations**

One prevalent issue users encounter is Google Assistant misunderstanding or misinterpreting voice commands. This can be influenced by factors such as background noise, accent variations, or pronunciation differences.

2. **Limited context understanding**

While Google Assistant is adept at understanding individual commands, it may struggle with complex, multi-step requests that rely heavily on context. Break down your tasks into simpler commands to enhance comprehension and execute it more accurately.

3. **Inability to execute certain tasks**

Google Assistant's capabilities are extensive, but there are instances where it may struggle to execute specific tasks. For example, it can’t execute tasks that involve interacting with certain third-party applications or services. You can't also **unlock phone with voice Google Assistant.**

1. **Speak Clearly and Naturally**

Make sure that you speak in a clear and natural manner. Avoid mumbling or speaking too quickly. Enunciate your words, giving Google Assistant a better chance to interpret your commands accurately.

2. **Use Simple and Direct Phrases**

Keep your commands simple and direct. Avoid unnecessary elaboration or complex sentence structures. Google Assistant is more likely to understand straightforward commands.

3. **Check Your Microphone**

Ensure that your device's microphone is in good working condition. Dirt or debris on your phone's microphone can affect its performance. Clean the microphone area and try again.

## Pattern Locks Are Unsafe: Secure Your Itel P40+ Phone Now with These Tips

Pattern locks have been available for about as long as people can remember, and they have been hugely popular with people thanks to how easy it is to simply swipe your screen and unlock your smartphone, as against, say, keying in the 4-digit PIN/ 6-digit PIN. However, pattern locks are easy to crack, and today, we bring you all you want to know about pattern locks and how to create a **hard pattern lock**. Further to this, we also tell you how to move beyond pattern locks and what to do in case you forgot the hard pattern lock you just set and are unable to unlock your smartphone.

![creating more secure pattern locks](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks

Pattern lock is an Android-only feature that makes it easy for users to have a modicum of security on their smartphones. Most users do not prefer using and remembering a PIN to unlock the smartphone. Creating a pattern makes it easier, somehow.

There is a 9-point grid on which you swipe your finger from point to point, in any direction, and when you take your finger off, that pattern you swiped becomes the key to unlock your smartphone.

Pattern locks were exceedingly common only a few years ago, and they are not recommended for use any longer due to concerns (mentioned later in the article).

### 1.1: Popularity and Usage

Old habits die hard, or so they say, right? That’s because it is true. We are creatures of habit, and pattern locks have been around for a long, long time. We are accustomed to pattern locks. So, even with even easier technologies such as fingerprint recognition and face recognition, we tend to gravitate towards the familiar old pattern lock.

The only thing is, there is a reason why pattern locks are no longer the preferred option to use for unlocking your smartphones. As it happens, that reason is security, and it can be very easy for humans to take a swipe (pardon the pun) at your pattern lock. And guess what? The research conducted suggests that they would get it right with an unsettling accuracy.

### 1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks

With on-the-go lifestyles, our smartphones have become indispensable and contain some of the most sensitive aspects of our lives – IDs, credit and debit cards in digital wallets, photo and video memories, business documents – you name it, the smartphones have it, on the go. This has opened our lives up to the public at large, and if someone steals our smartphone or, best case, finds it, the only barrier preventing them from being privy to all that wealth of our sensitive information is that screen lock – the pattern lock that we set on our smartphones. That’s it – the single pattern lock stands between malicious actors and our data. You might be beginning to realize just how crazy this is.

#### Advantages of Pattern Locks

There are two advantages to using pattern locks. One, they are better than nothing. Two, they are easy to use. And that’s about it. There is no third advantage to pattern locks. We might think we set a hard pattern lock that nobody could guess, but, as research proves, we might be thinking too low of human prowess.

#### Disadvantages of Pattern Locks

Security, or rather, the lack of it, is the lone disadvantage of using a pattern lock. What good is a pattern lock that can be easily deciphered? Sure, they are easy to use, and they are better than not having anything, but would you really want to protect your life’s data with something that could be, as researchers found out, breached in under 5 attempts? We don’t think you do!

The research found that 64% of test subjects who were shown videos of people unlocking their phones could correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock, that too after viewing the video only once! That number shot up to 80% if they were allowed to see the video again. That is simply astounding and a nightmare for security. When it comes to PINs, only 11% could guess a 6-digit PIN after viewing the unlocking video once, and that number shot up to 27% when they could see the video two times.

## Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)

Now, if you must continue using a pattern lock, let’s help you know how to create a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy to decipher as easy pattern locks. For that, you should know how people use pattern locks, the kind of pattern locks they create, and the ones that are the most commonly used pattern locks. That way, you can avoid those fallacies and create a hard pattern lock for your smartphone.

### 2.1: The Pattern Locks People Use Most Commonly

![common pattern locks](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-2.jpg)

Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, gave a presentation on pattern locks at DEFCON 23 and made a bold claim. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.”

She presented the following statistics to support her claim:

- \- In her research, she found that 77% of people started with one of the 4 corners when creating a pattern lock.
- \- 44% of people started with the top-left dot and 15% with the top-right, while the bottom-left was preferred by 14% of her test subjects.
- \- People set 5-point pattern locks on average, and most users were content with a 4-point pattern.

These are some of the most common pattern locks people create:

- \- patterns in the shapes of alphabets,
- \- patterns in the shapes of numerals,
- \- patterns in any other simple shape, such as square, triangle, star, etc.

To understand how this is a security nightmare, the possible combinations for a 4-point pattern are a measly 1624, whereas by adding just 1 more point to the pattern and creating a 5-point pattern, the number of possible combinations becomes 7152, an increase of 5528 combinations. In stark contrast, creating a 9-point pattern would give you over 140,000 possible combinations!

### 2.2: How to Create a Hard Pattern Lock

Knowing what most people do when creating a pattern lock, it becomes easy to avoid those mistakes and instead create a hard pattern lock for oneself.

- \- Do not start creating a pattern lock from any of the 4 corners of the grid.
- \- Never use your first initial as your pattern lock.
- \- Never use the shape of a numeral as your pattern lock.
- \- Use all 9 points on the grid to create your pattern lock, and contrary to popular belief, you can go over the connecting lines several times, creating a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy for people to decipher!

## Part 3: Going Beyond Pattern Locks

You might think that now that you have set a hard pattern lock, you are good to go. Hardly. Technology has evolved, so have methods to break into your device.

#### Step 1: Set a 6-digit PIN

The minimum you should do today is set a 6-digit PIN to unlock your phone. Consider this a necessary investment into the safety of your data residing on your smartphone.

#### Step 2: Use Fingerprint Recognition (or Face Recognition on Apple Devices)

All modern smartphones released over the last decade have come with fingerprint recognition. Using fingerprint recognition requires you to set a 6-digit PIN and then set a fingerprint to unlock your device. You can set additional fingerprints, too.

This way, your device is the most secure it can be today. In case your fingerprint is not recognized for any reason, the phone falls back on the 6-digit PIN that you can enter and unlock your phone.

While face recognition is available on both Android and Apple devices, it is truly secure only on Apple devices. This is why Apple iPhones released after the iPhone X in 2017 have come only with Face ID. They fall back on a minimum 6-digit PIN (called Passcode in Apple world) to unlock in case the face does not get recognized in the first attempt.

## Part 4: How To Unlock Phone If Hard Pattern Lock Forgotten

Just in case you set a hard pattern lock and promptly forgot that abstruse pattern you just set, we have a tool for you to quickly unlock your phone in case of a forgotten hard pattern lock: Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.

## Closing Words

Whether it is an easy pattern lock or a hard pattern lock, the fact is that pattern locks are antiquated and a security nightmare. A minimum 6-digit PIN must be used, and using fingerprint recognition is the preferred way to go for Android devices. Using fingerprint recognition will require that users create a 6-digit PIN. On Apple devices launched after 2017, there is Face ID, Apple’s marketing term for face recognition. If you did indeed still set a hard pattern lock, only to promptly forget it, use Wondershare Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (Android) to seamlessly unlock your phone right now.
