## Part 1: Unlock Your Locked Screen Without Password By 6 Efficient Ways

### 1\. By your Google account

You need to log into the Google account that is associated with the Vivo S18e device, then do the following:

- "Forgot pattern" will show up at the bottom of the screen.

- That's it; from this point forward, you may enter any new PIN or pattern that you can recall to unlock your smartphone.

### 2\. Google Find My Device

Using your Google account is a superb method for finding the Vivo S18e device when lost or stolen.

In addition, it may be used to lock or ring your smartphone. You may have noticed that there are three options available when using this feature: "Ring," "Lock," and "Erase."

To bypass the Android lock screen, all you need to do is sign into the Vivo S18e device's associated Google account and then follow these steps:

- On any Android device or a computer, go to <www.google.com/android/find> and sign in using your Google account. Choose the Android smartphone you wish to unlock after that.
- After choosing the Vivo S18e device, select one of the three options, "lock," from the list.

- Press and hold the Volume Up and Side buttons simultaneously until you see the brand logo on the screen for Android devices without a Power/Bixby/Home button.
