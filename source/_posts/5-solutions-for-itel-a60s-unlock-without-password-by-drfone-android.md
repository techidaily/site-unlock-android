## Part 1: Lock System About Itel A60s  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Itel A60s  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Itel A60s  with its privacy password settings.

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Itel A60s  with Find My Device.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization.

Here are the steps for **Itel A60s  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Itel A60s  with the power button.
