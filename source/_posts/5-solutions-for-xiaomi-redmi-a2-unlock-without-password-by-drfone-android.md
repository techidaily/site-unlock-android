### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Xiaomi Redmi A2  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Xiaomi Redmi A2  is one of the older versions of Xiaomi  android phones that was released in 2016.

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Xiaomi Redmi A2  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Xiaomi Redmi A2  with Find My Device.

Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Xiaomi  device using your Google Account.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization.

Here are the steps for **Xiaomi Redmi A2  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Xiaomi Redmi A2  with the power button.
