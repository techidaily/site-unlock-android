- Similar to a PIN but potentially more secure due to the allowance of a longer combination of numbers and letters. A passcode is ideal for those who seek an extra layer of security. You set it up in the security settings and use it to unlock your phone just like a PIN but with the added complexity of alphanumeric characters.
- **Face Unlock.Pixel’s Face Unlock** uses advanced facial recognition software. It scans your face to grant access, offering a hands-free and quick way to unlock your Pixel. This feature can be activated in the security settings and requires a simple glance at your phone to unlock.
