## Method 1: Unlock Vivo Y100 5G  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern. Since these may also be easily guessed by people who are in possession of your device illegally, Google deprecated this method after Android 4.4. However, the phones running Android 4.4 or lower are still allowed to be unlocked using this method. So, if you have an old Vivo Y100 5G  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Vivo Y100 5G  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Vivo Y100 5G  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

Between Android 4.4 and the Android 12 prevalent today, there have been massive security updates and code improvements that you can benefit from. It makes sense given that our phones hold a substantially large part of our personal and professional lives these days. And we are not even talking about features that you may or may not need - we are talking only from a data security point of view.

This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box.

## Bonus Tip: If You Want To Disable Screen Lock

### 1\. Contact your carrier

Your carrier can also unlock your voicemail. Get in touch with your carrier and ask for an unlock. For unlocking, your account may need to satisfy certain conditions. The request can take a few days to be processed after you submit it.
