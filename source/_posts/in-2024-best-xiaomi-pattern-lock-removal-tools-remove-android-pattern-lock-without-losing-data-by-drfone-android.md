### 1\. Fingerprint Sensor Not Touched Firmly

#### Problem

If the fingerprint sensor fails to recognize your fingerprint, it might be due to inadequate pressure. This could also be due to improper finger placement on the sensor.

#### Solution: Firm Placement

Ensure you firmly place your finger on the sensor, covering it entirely. Avoid too much pressure, but make sure the sensor fully contacts your fingerprint.

![gently press fingerprint sensor](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-5.jpg)

### 2\. Device Showing Glitches

#### Problem

Glitches or software bugs in your Pixel device may cause disruptions. This can include issues with the fingerprint sensor's functionality. These problems can range from minor issues to severe software glitches.

#### Solution: Restart Your Pixel Device

One of the easiest and simplest solutions is to restart your Pixel phone. You can do that by pressing the "Power" and the "Volume Up" keys. It will lead to a pop-up power menu where you must choose "Restart" to reboot your device.

![restart google pixel device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-6.jpg)

### 3\. Outdated Firmware

#### Problem

An outdated operating system or firmware can lead to compatibility issues. This can lead to malfunctioning features like the **Pixel 6A fingerprint sensor not working**.

#### Solution: Check for Updates

The best way to resolve this issue is to update your Pixel device. Having an outdated version of Android OS can lead to an accumulation of bugs and glitches. Moreover, it can seriously affect the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device's performance, causing many issues. Here is how to check and update your Pixel phone:

**Instructions.** On your Pixel device, access the “Settings” app. Within Settings, scroll down to tap the "System" option. On the following screen, hit the "System update" option to check if any latest update is available. Here, if you see any updates, download and install them promptly.

![update device to latest version](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-7.jpg)

### 4\. Dirty Phone or Sensor

#### Problem

Accumulated dirt, dust, or residue on the phone or fingerprint sensor can cause obstruction. This can lead to the failure to properly recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone

Employ a gentle, dry microfiber cloth for wiping down the complete surface of your Pixel device. Take particular care to thoroughly clean the region surrounding the fingerprint sensor. Refrain from utilizing rough substances or strong chemicals as they could potentially cause harm to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device.

##### 2\. Fingerprint Sensor Cleaning

Gently wipe the fingerprint sensor area using a clean, dry cloth to ensure thorough cleaning. For better results, consider using a dampened cotton swab with water or isopropyl alcohol. Before using it again, ensure the sensor is entirely dry.

##### 3\. Compressed Air or Soft Brush

![dirty sensor or phone issue](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-8.jpg)

### 5\. Screen Protector: Dirty or Damaged

#### Problem

A smudged or impaired screen protector might disrupt the working of the fingerprint sensor. This can potentially cause it to fail to recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Clean the Screen Protector

Start by effectively cleaning the screen protector on your Pixel device. For a thorough cleaning, consider utilizing a screen cleaning solution. Ensure that the screen protector is free from any dirt or debris.

##### 2\. Replace Damaged Protectors

Is the screen protector visibly damaged, scratched, or peeling off? If yes, consider replacing it with a new one. Damaged protectors can hinder fingerprint recognition and compromise device protection.

##### 3\. Check Compatibility

Ensure the screen protector is designed to be compatible with fingerprint sensors. Some protectors may obstruct or interfere with the sensor's functionality.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleanse and Dry Your Hands

Remove any dirt, oil, or moisture that might cause issues with the fingerprint sensor. It's crucial to wash and thoroughly dry your hands. Additionally, verify that your fingers are entirely dry before engaging the sensor. The reason is any moisture or dampness may cause inaccuracies in fingerprint identification.

Fingerprint marks or smudges on the screen might disrupt sensor functionality. This leads to inaccurate recognition when you try to unlock your device.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Avoid Covering the Sensor Area

Be cautious while cleaning the screen to avoid covering or smudging the area around the fingerprint sensor. Precise cleaning around this area prevents interference with sensor functionality.

##### 2\. Use Proper Holding Technique

AcDisplay comes with a rather minimalistic look similar to some of the most popular web site creator services like Squarespace or Wix. The home screen will highlight notifications for which it will offer two options, either you swipe down in which case you will ignore the notification, or swipe anywhere else and the lock screen will unlock. What's really great about this Android unlock app is the fact that it can use your device's sensors, allowing it to detect its placement therefore whether or not it should be on or off.

## 9.C Locker Pro

It would be unjust to call it an Android unlock app, this application is actually a carefully selected package that allows you to do a lot of cools stuff with your new and improved home screen.

The app has every other usual options including setting your favorite apps or showing the lock, as well as the date and the temperature of course.

## 10\. Echo Notificaiton Lockscreen

Another minimalistic design that works quite well, it also allows you to set different notification categories like "work", "media" or "social". Not only that, but you can also choose various apps to go with those categories. Messages come through as well of course, all with a "slide to unlock" feature that is so popular these days.

How to unlock : Slide right like you would with an iOS device.
