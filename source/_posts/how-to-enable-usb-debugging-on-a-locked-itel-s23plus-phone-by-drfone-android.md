## How To Track IMEI Number Of Itel S23+ Through Google Earth?

When losing your phone, having a reliable tool at your fingertips can make all the difference. That tool is IMEI tracking, your secret weapon for locating your lost or stolen device. IMEI is a unique number that every mobile device possesses. It's like a fingerprint for your phone.

Now, the question is, is it possible **to track an IMEI number through Google Earth**? This question has sparked much debate on the internet, so this article aims to find it out. Keep reading and learn the secrets of **Google Earth IMEI trackers**.

![google earth imei tracker](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-01.jpg)

## Part 1: How To Track Your Itel S23+ on Google Earth

This **Google Maps IMEI number tracking** issue has caused quite a buzz and controversy on the internet. It has raised many concerns regarding the safety and privacy of every smartphone user. To tell you the truth, Google Earth lacks IMEI location data and does not provide such capabilities. Thus, there is no truth in **tracking IMEI numbers through Google Earth**.

However, if you have access to a cell phone's GPS coordinates or the location of a cell tower to which it is linked, you can use Google Earth to follow its location.

### How To Locate a Smartphone Using Google Earth

Many current smartphones include GPS receivers that allow them to pinpoint their exact location. If you know the phone's GPS coordinates, you can plug them into Google Earth to see where it is on the map.

- **Step 1:** This process won't be possible if your location services are not enabled on your phone. To do this, navigate to **Settings,** then **Location** on Android, and **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Location Services** on iOS.

![iphone location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-02.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Google Earth can be downloaded and installed on your computer or mobile device. It works with Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. Download it from your device's **Google Earth** website or the app store.

![install google earth android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-03.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Sign in to Google Earth using the Google Account linked to the phone you want to track. This step is required to acquire location data and [monitor IMEI numbers](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-unlock/check-imei-number-location.html) using Google Earth.

Choose the Itel S23+ device you want to track from the dropdown menu if you have numerous devices linked to the same account. The timeline displays the selected device's location history for the set date. Examine the locations visited, the routes taken, and the time spent at each spot. For further information, select a certain location or time.

![google maps location history](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-05.jpg)

**Note:** Google Earth does not support real-time location tracking by default. You can use the **Find My Device** function on Android or **Find My** on iOS instead if you want to track your phone's real-time location.

## Part 2: Google Earth Alternatives: Track Phone Using IMEI Number

## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Itel S23+ 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions.

The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Itel S23+ device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.
