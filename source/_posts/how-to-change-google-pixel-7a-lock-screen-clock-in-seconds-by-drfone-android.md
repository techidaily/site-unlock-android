Step 5: Use the volume keys of the Google Pixel 7a device to select Fastboot option along with pressing power button to confirm, after the Google Pixel 7a device is in bootloader mode. Now, connect the Google Pixel 7a device to the computer using a USB cable.

![htc unlock bootloader](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/12/14822588941681.jpg)

Step 6: Go to Fastboot folder on the PC and holding down the shift key, click on any empty space followed by a click on “Open command window here”.

Step 7: In the command prompt window, type “fastboot devices” and press enter. Google Pixel 7a  will show up in the command prompt.

Note: The drivers have to be installed correctly to see the Google Pixel 7a device in the command prompt. So, if the Google Pixel 7a device does not show up, reinstall HTC Sync Manager and try again after restarting the computer.

Step 8: On HTC Dev’s website third page, click on “proceed to Step 9”. Follow the steps listed and then click on submit. The unlock token code for the Google Pixel 7a device will be mailed by HTC. Download the token and name it “Unlock\_code.bin” and place the token in the fastboot folder.

Step 9: Now, in the command prompt window, type the following:

fastboot flash unlocktoken Unlock\_code.bin

Step 10: On the Google Pixel 7a , one message will appear asking if you want to unlock the Google Pixel 7a device bootloader.

![htc unlock bootloader](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/12/14822585759420.jpg)

Use volume keys to select and power button to confirm. Once this is done, the Google Pixel 7a  device will restart once and it’s done. The device is now bootloader unlocked.
