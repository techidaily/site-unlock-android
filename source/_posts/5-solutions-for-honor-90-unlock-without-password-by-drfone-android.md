## Part 1: Lock System About Honor 90  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Honor 90  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Honor 90  is one of the older versions of Honor  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Honor 90  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Honor 90  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Honor 90  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Honor 90  with Find My Device.
