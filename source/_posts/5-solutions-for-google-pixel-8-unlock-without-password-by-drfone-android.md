### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Google Pixel 8  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Google Pixel 8  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Google Pixel 8  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Google Pixel 8  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Google Pixel 8  with Find My Device.
