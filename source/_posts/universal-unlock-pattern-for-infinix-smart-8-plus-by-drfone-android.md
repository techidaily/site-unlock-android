However, the process may seem a bit time-consuming to you. Here is how you can do it.

### Way 2: Boot into Safe Mode to Bypass Third-Party App Screen Lock

**Step 2**: Now, long tap the "Power Off" button and click "OK" when shown the pop-up.

After a few failed attempts, the warning "Try again in 30 seconds" appears and here is where the steps begin. Let us get to know in detail.

**Step 2**: Select the "Forgot Pattern" option below the message.
