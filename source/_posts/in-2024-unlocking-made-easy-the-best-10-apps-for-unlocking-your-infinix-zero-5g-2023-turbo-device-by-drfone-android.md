Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization.

Here are the steps for **Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo  with the power button.

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern.
