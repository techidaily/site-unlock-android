Forgetting the pattern lock of a device and getting locked out of it is probably one of the most frustrating scenarios faced by Android users. Nevertheless, unlike popular operating systems, Android provides a seamless way to past the forgot pattern lock feature.

You can either try Google’s native solution or a third-party tool in case you have forgotten the pattern lock on your device and reset it.

To make things easier for you, we have provided three simple solutions to resolve forgotten patterns on Android devices.

## Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the 'Forgot Pattern' feature?

One of the easiest and fastest ways to fix the forgot pattern lock issue on a device is by using its inbuilt “Forgot Pattern” feature. If you are using an Android 4.4 or earlier version, then you can simply access this feature. Since users can hack an Android device just by knowing the Google credentials of the connected device, the solution was later discontinued (as it was considered a security vulnerability). Nevertheless, if your device hasn’t been updated and you are using an Android 4.4 or previous version, then you can bypass the forgot pattern lock by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.

**Step 2.** On the same prompt, you can see an option of “Forgot pattern” on the bottom. Simply tap on it.

**Step 4.** To reset the forgot pattern lock, you need to provide the correct Google credentials of the account already linked to the Vivo S18 device.

## Part 2. Some Prominent Limitations of vnROM Bypass

**vnROM Bypass** offers a solution for bypassing FRP lock on certain Android devices. Yet, it comes with several notable limitations that necessitate exploring alternative options. The following are some of the limitations of vnROM Bypass:

### 1\. Limited Compatibility

vnROM Bypass primarily supports Android versions 5.0 to 8.1 (Lollipop to Oreo). Hence, it fails to function on devices operating on more recent Android versions. Android 9 through 14 users might encounter compatibility issues and inefficacy when utilizing this tool.

### 2\. Security Risks

Using bypass tools like vnROM Bypass can potentially expose devices to security risks. One significant factor contributing to this situation is the absence of an official website for the tool. Furthermore, it has not received updates for quite a while. This makes it a potential security risk for newer Android models.

### 3\. Functional Restrictions

This tool has not received updates for some time, so its proper functionality cannot be guaranteed. It seems primarily compatible with older Android devices running on versions 5 through 8.1. Moreover, serious concerns exist about the tool's effectiveness, even for older devices.

### 4\. Complexity and Reliability Issues

The bypass process using vnROM Bypass can be complex. For users unfamiliar with such tools, it could lead to potential errors. The reliability of the tool's effectiveness varies across different devices and firmware versions. This results in inconsistent outcomes.
