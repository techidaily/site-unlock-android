## 5\. RainbowCrack : New Innovation in Password Hash Cracker

RainbowCrack software uses rainbow tables to crack hashes, in other words we can say it uses process of a large-scale time-memory trade for effective and fast password cracking.

Large-scale-time-memory-trade-off is a process of computing all hashes and plain text using a selected hash algorithm. After calculations, obtained results are stored in the tables called rainbow table. Process of creating rainbow tables is very time consuming but when its done software works very fast.

Password cracking using rainbow table is faster than the normal brute force attack method. It’s available for Linux and Windows operating system.

## 8\. L0phtCrack : Smart tool for Windows password recovery

Just like OphCrack tool L0phtCrack is also a Windows passwords recovery tool uses hashes to crack passwords, with extra features of Brute force and [dictionary attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack).

It normally gains access to these hashes from directories, network servers, or domain controllers. It is capable of doing hash extraction from 32 & 64 bit Windows systems, multiprocessor algorithms, scheduling, and can also perform decoding and monitoring networks. Yet it is still the easiest to use password auditing and recovery software available.

## 9\. Pwdump : Password recovery tool for Windows

Pwdump is actually different Windows programs that are used to provide [LM and NTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LM_hash) hashes of system user accounts.

Pwdump password cracker is capable of extracting LM, NTLM and LanMan hashes from the target in Windows, in case if [Syskey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syskey) is disabled, software has the ability to extract in this condition.

Software is update with extra feature of password histories display if history is available. Extracted data will be available in form that is compatible with L0phtcrack.
