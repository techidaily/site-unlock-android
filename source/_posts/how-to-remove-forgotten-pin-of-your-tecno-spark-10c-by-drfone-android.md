## How to Unlock a Network Locked Tecno Spark 10C Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Tecno Spark 10C phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Tecno Spark 10C device is purchased.

This scenario puts forward the need for **Tecno Spark 10C network unlock** solutions.
