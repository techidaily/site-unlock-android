## Part 1: Lock System About Itel P40  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Itel P40  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Itel P40  is one of the older versions of Itel  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Itel P40  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Itel P40  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Itel P40  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Itel P40  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Itel P40  with Find My Device.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools.

Here are the steps for **Itel P40  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Itel P40  with the power button.
