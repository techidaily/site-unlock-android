PRECAUTION:  At best, this can be the first level of security, as one who resembles you to some extent can unlock the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device. Photographs are not stored in the system. The device does hold necessary data to recognize your face, and the security level is determined by how good the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device is configured. The data is not accessed by any app or loaded onto a Google server for backup.

_Setting Up Trusted Face_

- • Go to Smart Lock and tap Trusted Face.
- • Tap on Setup. Follow on-screen instructions.

The device begins to gather data about your face. The trusted face icon appears. As a backup, in case Smart Lock does not recognize your face, use the manual system by applying the PIN or password to unlock the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device.

- • Tap on Next and follow instructions on the screen to complete the task.

Smart Lock Android is a great feature and is only going to improve on time. With added security measures being introduced by Google for Bluetooth and NFC unlock android devices, including configuration to Google maps and Gmail, the feature may be one of the most important features to overcome constant blocking of devices even in protected places.
