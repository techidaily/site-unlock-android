So, if you have an old Vivo Y28 5G  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Vivo Y28 5G  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Vivo Y28 5G  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:
