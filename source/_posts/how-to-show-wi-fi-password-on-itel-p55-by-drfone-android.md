## How to Show Wi-Fi Password on Itel P55

Since the invention of Android OS in 2008 by Andy Rubin, our world has faced a dramatic change. Android seems to be controlling a considerably high portion of our life. We have bought many gadgets that use this amazing OS and most of which are phones. But how much can you do with your Android phone? Developers are always making it more interesting to use this interface.

Most of the time, we use Android phones, we get faced with the need to access the internet. The Wi-Fi capability of these Android gadgets makes it super easy for us to surf the web. Throughout using Wi-Fi, we connect to a number of them. This could be at school, a sub-way caf√©, the gym, buses, hospitals, hotels, towns, and the list is endless. A password secures most of this. Needless to say, our brain is weak to store all these passwords for future use, especially if you would want to connect with a different gadget you have recently bought or even your laptop.

## Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device

### What is Rooting?

First of all, what does rooting mean? You have probably used a Windows computer or even Linux. For the case of Windows, when installing a new program or software, it always prompts a dialog box saying, "Administrator permission required to run this program." If you don't have the administrator permission, you won't install the program. In Android, this is called rooting. In simple terms, it means having the root permission to your phone. Some Android apps will require you the root permission, e.g., flashing your ROM. In this part, we will explain how you can show the Wi-Fi password on your Android with root.

To find the Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone, you need to have an app to explore files which also supports a root user. In this case, ES FileExplorer or Root Explorer will come in handy. However, it turns out that the latter is offered at $3. Let's use the free ES File Explorer.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556285763404.jpg)

### Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root

In only four steps, we, at this moment, learn how we can find the password of a Wi-Fi on an Android phone.

Step 1: Install the ES File Explorer

Download the ES File Explorer from your play store, install it, and open it.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556286507084.jpg)

Step 2: Enable Root Explorer

The root explorer needs to be enabled so that you can reach the root folders of the Wi-Fi passwords you need. By default, the root feature in this ES explorer is not enabled. To enable it, just tap on the list menu on the top left corner.:

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556292611536.jpg)

This will drop down a list of controls. Scroll down and find the **Root Explorer** option and enable it.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293052566.jpg)

Step 3: Get the passwords' file.

Go back to ES file explorer, and this time, find the folder named **data**.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293412707.jpg)

When this folder opens, find another one named **misc**. Open it and find another one named **wifi**. Here, find a file named **wpa\_supplicant.conf**.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293762552.jpg)

Step 4: Retrieve the wifi password on Android

Make sure that you don't edit anything in the file. You might mess up with important data and fail to access the Wi-Fi(s) in the future.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556294042257.jpg)

As you can see above, we have found the Wi-Fi passwords on the android device. On each network profile, we have the name of the network represented by _name (ssid="{the name}")_, the network's password represented by _psk_, the network's access point represented by _key\_mgmt=WPA-PSK_ and its priority represented by _priority_.

## Part 2: Show Wifi Password on Android without Root

What if I don't have root access to my Android, can I still see Android Wi-Fi password? The short answer is yes. However, this is a bit involving but simple. You don't need to be a computer guru to do it, but you need to have a computer and some internet access of course. The key thing is to find a way through which we can fetch the password file from the phone without using a root access protocol in the Android. This is made possible by some little programming insight using the Windows Command prompt.

### Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root

Step 1: Access the Developer authority

To access the files that Android uses to run passwords, you must first become a developer. This is very simple.

Get your Android phone and go to settings. Scroll down and find "About phone." Tap on it and scroll down again to find Build number.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556302638925.jpg)

Tap on this "build number" 5 to 6 times until a message pops up, saying, "You are now a developer".

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556303263992.jpg)

Step 2: Enable the debugging.

Go back to Settings. Scroll down for developer options. Turn on the button for "Android/USB debugging".

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556308665697.jpg)

Step 3: Install ADB drivers.

Now, open your Windows desktop. Download and install ADB drivers. (Use this download link [adbdriver.com](http://adbdriver.com/)). You need to download and install platform tools (minimal ADB and fastboot) from [http://forum.xda-developers.com/...](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2317790) Now open the folder where you've installed the above tools. By default, it is in the Local disc _C\\windows\\system32\\platform\_tools_ location. However, you might want to locate them by searching on the windows search engine. You have to hold the Shift key and right-click inside the folder to click on"Open Command Window Here."

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329561742.jpg)

Step 4: Test the ADB

Here, we would like to test whether the ABD is working properly. To do this, connect your phone to the PC using a USB. In the command prompt, type **adb services** and then press enter. If it's working properly, you should see a device on this list.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329984622.jpg)

Step 5: Find the Android wifi password.

Now, it is time to type the given command in the command prompt and type: _adb pull /data/misc/wifi/wpa\_supplicant.conf c:/wpa\_supplicant.conf_. This will fetch the file from your phone to the local disc C drive of the PC.

Step 6: Get the wifi passwords.

Lastly, open the file with a notepad, and there you go.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556331232772.jpg)

Now you learned how to show the wifi password on your Android device.

## Solution 3: Unlock the Itel Phone Using Google Login (only Android 4.4 and below)

If your Itel device runs on Android 4.4 and previous versions, then you can easily move past the password/pattern lock without any trouble. The provision is not available on devices, which run on newer versions of Android. Nevertheless, for all the Itel P55 devices running on older versions than Android 4.4, this is undoubtedly the easiest way to set a new passcode. Follow these steps to learn how to unlock your Itel phone if you forgot your password using your Google credentials.

- **Step 1.** Try bypassing the pattern lock at least 5 times. After all the failed attempts, you will get the option to either make an emergency call or choose the option of ‚Äú**Forget pattern**‚Äù.

![unlock lg forgot password - log in google account](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892203377058.jpg)

## Solution 4: Unlock the Itel Phone Using Custom Recovery (SD card needed)

If your phone has a removable SD card, you can also try this technique to disable the pattern/password on your device. Though, you need to have some custom recovery installed on your device for this method. You can always go for TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project) and flash it on your device.

TWRP: <https://twrp.me/>

Also, since you can't move anything to your device when it is locked, you need to do the same using its SD card. After ensuring that you have met all the basic prerequisites, follow these steps and learn how to unlock the Itel phone's forgotten password using a custom recovery.

- **Step 1.** Download a [Pattern Password Disable](http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=2532214&d=1390399283) application and save its ZIP file on your computer. Now, insert your SD card into your system and move the recently downloaded file to it.

- **Step 2.** Reboot your phone into recovery mode. For instance, the TWRP recovery mode can be turned on by simultaneously pressing the Power, Home, and Volume Up button. You would get different options on your screen after entering the custom recovery mode. Tap on ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù and browse the Pattern Password Disable application file.

![unlock lg forgot password - team win recovery project](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892204165153.jpg)

- **Step 3.** Install the above-mentioned application and wait for a few minutes. Afterward, restart your Itel phone. Ideally, your phone will be restarted without any lock screen. If you get a lock screen, you can bypass it by entering any random digits.

## Solution 5: Factory Reset Itel Phone in Recovery Mode (erases all phone data)

If none of the above-mentioned alternatives work, then you can also try to factory reset your device. This will erase every kind of data from your device and make it look brand new by resetting it. Though, you can easily resolve the forgot password on the Itel phone with it. Therefore, before proceeding, you need to be familiar with all the repercussions of performing a factory reset. All you got to do is follow these steps.

- **Step 1.** Put your Itel phone on its recovery mode with correct key combinations. To do this, firstly, turn your device off and let it rest for a few seconds. Now, press the Power and Volume Down key at the same time. Keep pressing them until you see LG's logo on the screen. Release the buttons for a few seconds and press them again at the same time. Again, keep pressing the buttons until you see the recovery mode menu. This technique works with most Itel devices, but it can differ slightly from one model to another.

- **Step 2.** Choose ‚ÄúWipe Data/Factory Reset.‚Äù You can use the Volume up and down key to navigate the options and the power/home key to select anything. Use these keys and select the ‚ÄúWipe Data/Factory Reset‚Äù option. You might get another pop-up asking to delete all user data. Just agree it reset your device. Sit back and relax as your device will perform a hard reset.

![unlock lg forgot password - enter in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892204518630.jpg)

After following these steps, you can easily overcome how to unlock the Itel phone forgot password issue.

## Solution 6: Unlock Itel Phone Using ADB Command (need USB debugging enabled)

This might be a little complicated initially, but if you don't want to follow either of the above-mentioned techniques to unlock your device, you can go with this alternative. Before proceeding, make sure that you have ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed on your computer. If you don't have it, then you can download Android SDK right [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

Additionally, it would help if you turned on the USB Debugging feature on your phone before you forgot the password. If USB debugging is not turned on before, then this method will not work for you.

After making your device ready and downloading all the essential software on your computer, follow these steps to learn how to unlock your Itel phone if you forgot the password.

- **Step 1.** Connect your device to the computer with a USB cable and open the command prompt when it is successfully connected. If you get a pop-up message regarding USB Debugging permission on your device, simply agree to it and continue.

- **Step 2.** Now, please provide the following code on the command prompt and reboot your device when it is processed. If you want, you can also tweak the code a little and provide a new lock pin.

- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.__db_
- _update system set value=0 where name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where name='lockscreen__.lockedoutpermanently';_

## Still Using Pattern Locks with Itel P55? Tips, Tricks and Helpful Advice

They have been along for a long, long time now ‚Äì pattern locks ‚Äì the easiest of all smartphone locks. You just swipe your finger across to create an **easy pattern lock** of your choosing and that‚Äôs it, it becomes your new screen lock. No more remembering tedious digits! So, why have these easy pattern locks become outdated, and why do people still continue to use them? Let‚Äôs take a dive and find out all about pattern locks.

![creating more secure pattern locks](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-1.jpg)

## Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks

The first cellphone locks were 4-digit number locks. Then came 6-digit codes, and even alphanumeric ones. Pattern locks were all the rage a while ago. Though pattern locks continue to be used, they are not considered safe to use any longer. What is all that about? Here‚Äôs what you need to know about pattern locks, whether you are a seasoned pattern lock user or not.

### I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?

Believe it or not, technology has advanced at such a rapid pace in the last two decades that you‚Äôd be forgiven if you don‚Äôt know what a pattern lock is, especially if you have only ever used iPhones, or Android phones in just the last few years.

Pattern locks are patterns you create on your smartphone and designate as a smartphone lock/ screen lock. There is a 9-point keypad of sorts, and you start swiping your finger from any point to any point for any which way you feel like. Android 13 allows a minimum of 4 points registered. They are easy to create, and easy to use, hence called easy pattern locks.

Pattern locks have only ever been offered on Android devices and were commonplace a few years ago until they were deemed not secure enough for use by modern standards because they were _easy_ to figure out by malicious actors.

### I.II: Popularity and Usage

Pattern lock is a feature unique to Android and has been so since the start. Naturally, it is one of the preferred ways users have come to unlock their Android devices over the years. Even though modern Android smartphones come with fingerprint recognition and face recognition technologies, there exists a large subset of users still addicted to and acclimatized with the pattern lock feature, opting over fingerprint and face recognition.

There has been, however, research conducted into the safety and security offered by pattern lock in Android.

### I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks

Modern smartphones very nearly contain the entirety of our lives; photo memories, video memories, important documents both financial and personal in nature, banking apps, ID and ATM/ credit cards in the ‚Äúwallet‚Äù apps, and whatnot. A smartphone falling into the wrong hands could very nearly be used to devastate the rightful owner, both financially and otherwise. And this is not a claim out of thin air; spyware/ malware/ phishing attacks are on the rise around the world. Locking the smartphone, once considered optional and an unnecessary hassle, is now an absolute must.

#### Advantages of Pattern Locks

There is no denying that using an **easy pattern lock** to lock their smartphone seems enough for most users. Swiping your finger across your smartphone to unlock it feels not only cool and futuristic but safer and more secure than remembering and punching in digits. And, for the most part, it is true, given that 4-digit PINs can only have 10,000 unique combinations!

#### Disadvantages of Pattern Locks

While very easy to use, security researchers and experts have come to agree that the feature is not in the least safe to use, and that is because of how people use the pattern lock feature (discussed in detail below in part II). Some go so far as to say that most pattern locks can be breached in just 5 attempts or less. Imagine that!

What is more, research has found that humans have an uncanny ability to correctly guess a pattern lock simply by viewing the unlocking! The test comprised showing the test subjects videos of users unlocking their phones from different angles and varying distances, and it was found that around 64% of test subjects were able to correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock in one viewing only, and 80% could correctly guess the pattern after just two viewings. By contrast, only 11% were able to correctly deduce a 6-digit PIN after one viewing, and only 27% after viewing twice. This goes to show just how insecure pattern locks are!

## Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks

We might wonder how anyone would be able to guess the correct pattern of our device, but believe it or not, it is possible, eerily easily at that! We are all the same humans, after all! You know how people usually set PINs that could be significant dates in their lives? How they get car registration numbers that mean something to them? The same ‚Äòlogic‚Äô applies to their setting pattern locks.

At DEFCON 23, Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, presented something that stunned people around the world. She said, ‚ÄúTell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.‚Äù What followed was an expert presentation outlining and detailing user behaviors around pattern locks.

These are some commonly created pattern locks by people:

- \- shapes of alphabets,
- \- shapes of numerals,
- \- any other easy-to-make, simple shape.

Marte Loge presented the image below, showing how people naturally gravitate towards creating simple shape patterns, in her research.

![common pattern locks](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-2.jpg)

To further help you see how easy it might be for anyone to guess your pattern, Marte Loge also presented some statistics.

- \- 77% of people started their patterns in one of the 4 corners.
- \- 44% of Loge‚Äôs subjects started their pattern with the first dot, the top-left one. The next number was 15% for the top-right and 14% for the bottom-left.
- \- These percentages did not vary much depending on left-handedness or right-handedness.
- \- On average, irrespective of gender, people set 5-point patterns, with 4-point patterns being the most common. This means that the number of combinations on average was 7152 for 5-point patterns and a bogglingly low 1624 for 4-point patterns.

The above data makes it amply clear how using an **easy pattern lock** is actually worse than using a 4-digit PIN, simply because how people are usually using the pattern lock feature.

## Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks

Now, we know how hard it is to break habits cemented over years of use, so in case you must at all costs use a pattern lock only, the least you can do is try and change your easy pattern lock to a better, more secure hard pattern lock.

#### III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns

Here are some tips to help you create a better, more secure pattern lock for your smartphone.

- \- Avoid using any of the corners to start the pattern.
- \- Never use your first initial as a pattern.
- \- Never use a digit shape as a pattern.
- \- You can pass through the same pattern lines multiple times over. This makes it more difficult for someone to guess your pattern correctly.
- \- Use all 9 points on the grid while setting the pattern lock! That simple act takes the possible pattern combinations to over 140,000, significantly more than 10,000 for 4-digit PINs, and vastly superior to paltry 1624 for a 4-point **easy pattern lock**!

#### III.II: Forgot Your Pattern? Unlock Your Itel P55 Without Pattern Lock With Dr.Fone

Supercharged with the information above, you went ahead and changed your easy pattern lock to a hard-to-guess pattern lock. Only problem is, your brain is habituated to that old pattern, and you‚Äôve suddenly forgotten what the new pattern was!

## Closing Words

Pattern locks are outdated and not safe to use an **easy pattern lock** ‚Äì there are no two ways about it. As such, our recommendation is to start using a 6-digit PIN along with biometric or face recognition. However, we do understand that sometimes, you simply cannot use biometrics or face recognition. For those instances, we recommend that you use this guide and create a more secure pattern lock for your device. In case you forgot your pattern, there is always Wondershare Dr.Fone ‚Äì Screen Unlock (Android) to save the day.
