## How to Lock Apps on Google Pixel Fold to Protect Your Individual Information

If you are not a fan of having to go through the process of getting through a [pattern](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/pattern-lock.html) or password every time you want to use your phone, the good news is that you don’t have to. There are really just a few Apps on your Android device that have sensitive information you don’t want others getting access to. It would really be great if you could lock those apps individually as opposed to locking the Google Pixel Fold device as a whole.

Well, in light of helping you out, this article will address just how you can lock Apps on your device and not have to type in a code every time you want to use the Google Pixel Fold device.

## Part 1. Why you need to Lock Apps on Android?

Before we get down to the business of locking some of your Apps, let’s look at some of the reasons why you would want to lock certain apps.

- You may simply want better access on your device. Locking certain apps will allow you to easily access the Google Pixel Fold device and use it without having to remember passwords and patterns.
- If you are a person who is not good at remembering passwords or patterns, simply locking certain apps will help you not get locked out of your entire device which can cause a lot of problems.
- If your device is used by more than one person, locking certain apps will keep the other users out of information you would rather they didn’t access.
- If you have children, you can eliminate the many accidental in-app purchases by locking the apps your children shouldn’t be on.
- Locking apps is also a good way to keep children from content they shouldn’t be accessing.

## Part 2. How to Lock Apps in Android

There is always a good reason to Lock Apps on your device and we have two easy and effective methods you can use to do this. Choose the one that you are most comfortable with.

### Method One: Using Smart App Protector

Smart App Protector is a freeware that allows you to lock specified applications.

Step 1: Download and Install Smart App Protector from the Google Play Store and Launch it. You may be required to install a helper application for Smart App Protector. This helper will ensure that the many App services running on your device will not be killed by third party apps.

Step 2: The default password 7777 but you can change this in the Password & Pattern Settings.
