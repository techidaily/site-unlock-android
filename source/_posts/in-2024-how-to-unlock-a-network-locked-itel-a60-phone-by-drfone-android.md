## How to Unlock a Network Locked Itel A60 Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Itel A60 phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Itel A60 device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Itel A60 network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Itel A60 Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Itel A60 phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased.

- 8\. Furthermore, you need to confirm your choice and provide the same pattern once again. Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.
- 9\. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well. In case if you will forget your pattern, then you can access your phone by taking the assistance of this pin.
