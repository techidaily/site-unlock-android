**Step 1.** Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.

If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Infinix Smart 8 Plus  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Infinix Smart 8 Plus :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.
