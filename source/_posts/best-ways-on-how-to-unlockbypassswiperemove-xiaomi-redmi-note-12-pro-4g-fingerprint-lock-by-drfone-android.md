One of the easiest and fastest ways to fix the forgot pattern lock issue on a device is by using its inbuilt “Forgot Pattern” feature.

Nevertheless, if your device hasn’t been updated and you are using an Android 4.4 or previous version, then you can bypass the forgot pattern lock by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.

## Part 5: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using Safe Mode

If you have locked your device using a third-party app, there exists a simple solution. You can use the Safe Mode to remove the problematic app. Safe Mode is intended for troubleshooting and disabling third-party apps. Following are the steps you need to follow to use Safe Mode to unlock your Android device:

**Step 1:** Initiating Safe Mode requires a simultaneous three-second press of the "Volume Down" and "Power" keys. When the power menu becomes visible, proceed to long-press the "Power Off" icon.

**Step 2:** In a moment, you'll see the option "Safe Mode" replacing the other "Power Off" menu options. Proceed to boot your device into Safe Mode and uninstall the troublesome application.

## Part 6: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using Factory Reset

Bypassing a forgotten pattern lock on an Android device using a factory reset is a last resort. The reason is it will erase all data on your device, including apps, photos, and settings. However, it can be an effective way to regain access to your device when other methods have failed. Here's how to do it:

**Step 1:** Turn off your Samsung device and connect it to your computer. Now press and hold “Volume Up” and “Power” keys for a while. Release the keys once the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G device enters Recovery Mode.

**Step 2:** In Recovery Mode, use the Volume keys to navigate to “Wipe data/factory reset” and select it with the “Power” key. Confirm the action on the next screen by selecting “Factory data reset.”
