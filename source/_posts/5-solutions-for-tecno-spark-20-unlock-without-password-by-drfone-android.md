Before we move towards the **Tecno Spark 20  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Tecno Spark 20  with Find My Device.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization.

Here are the steps for **Tecno Spark 20  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Tecno Spark 20  with the power button.

![disabling google smart lock feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-remove-or-disable-google-smart-lock-1.jpg)

## Part 1. Understanding Google Smart Lock and How It Works?

Want to know **what is Google Smart Lock**? [Google Smart Lock](https://get.google.com/smartlock/) serves as a multi-purpose tool within the Google ecosystem. It is designed to streamline security measures and password management access across platforms. At its core, Google Smart Lock operates as a feature that manages passwords. Google Smart Lock aims to enhance authentication processes. Primarily, it operates across Android devices and computers.

It offers a unified approach to security, ensuring you don’t have to remember all the passwords. Google Smart Lock securely stores and manages passwords for websites and apps. It enables users to access these services without repeatedly entering login details. When you visit a familiar website or app, Google Smart Lock fills in the login credentials. It automatically provides the login ID and password, maintaining effortless access.

## Part 2. Recognizing Some Top Features of Google Smart Lock

Google Smart Lock’s password management has revolutionized how users handle and secure their login credentials. It remains a cornerstone when handling Android devices and computer systems. The following are several notable features that significantly enhance user convenience and security:

### 1\. Password Autofill

Google Smart Lock simplifies the login process across apps and websites. It does that by automatically filling in saved credentials. This eliminates the need for users to remember and manually input passwords.

### 2\. Cross-Platform Synchronization

It synchronizes saved passwords across multiple devices using the same Google account. This ensures smooth access to credentials on Android devices and computers.

### 3\. Secure Storage

Passwords stored within Google Smart Lock are encrypted and securely stored in the user's Google account. This maintains confidentiality and safeguards sensitive login information.

### 4\. Effortless Password Generation

It allows the creation of strong and unique passwords when signing up for new accounts. That enhances overall account security and allows users to have strong passwords.

These features significantly ease the burden of password management and enhance user security. Yet, **Google Smart Lock** does have limitations that prompt some users to consider removing it.

### 4\. Preference for Third-Party Tools

Certain users might have a preference for specialized third-party password management tools. They can go for solutions that offer a wider array of features. Many users might want to find options better aligned with their specific needs. This prompts them to disable Google Smart Lock.
