## Part 1: Unlock Your Locked Screen Without Password By 6 Efficient Ways

### 1\. By your Google account

You need to log into the Google account that is associated with the Vivo S18 Pro device, then do the following:

- The unlock pattern may only be used five times before a notification telling you to try again in 30 seconds appears.
- "Forgot pattern" will show up at the bottom of the screen.

- You must enter the Gmail account that is associated with the Vivo S18 Pro device here before selecting "Next."

![answer the security question](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-2.jpg)

- That's it; from this point forward, you may enter any new PIN or pattern that you can recall to unlock your smartphone.

### 2\. Google Find My Device

Using your Google account is a superb method for finding the Vivo S18 Pro device when lost or stolen.

In addition, it may be used to lock or ring your smartphone. You may have noticed that there are three options available when using this feature: "Ring," "Lock," and "Erase."

To bypass the Android lock screen, all you need to do is sign into the Vivo S18 Pro device's associated Google account and then follow these steps:

- On any Android device or a computer, go to <www.google.com/android/find> and sign in using your Google account. Choose the Android smartphone you wish to unlock after that.
- After choosing the Vivo S18 Pro device, select one of the three options, "lock," from the list.

Many Samsung customers have this issue, which prevents them from using their devices. Try using the "Find My Mobile" feature on your mobile if you wish to unlock it if you're a Samsung user. It would be helpful if you had a Samsung or Android model account.

After that, use Find My Device to unlock your Android phone without losing any data by following the instructions below:

- Launch the installer after that to begin downloading crucial software for your machine.

![launch the adb installer to unlock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-6.jpg)

- Finally, just restart your smartphone and use it as normal.

### 4\. Hard reset (data loss)

Each brand has a unique method for hard resetting a locked Android device. The methods to factory reset locked Android devices from Samsung, LG, HTC, Sony, and Huawei are compiled here.

When your phone is locked, you may access the recovery menu of your phone using its physical keys and choose to hard reset the Vivo S18 Pro device. Here's how to restore a locked phone to factory settings.

- Use the buttons to see the recovery menu.
- Press and hold the Volume Up and Side buttons simultaneously until you see the brand logo on the screen for Android devices without a Power/Bixby/Home button.
