- Step 2. Accept the call and press the back button without disconnecting.
- Step 3. Now you can access the Honor X9a device completely
- Step 4. Go to the security settings of the Honor X9a device and remove the pattern or pin.
- Step 5. It will ask you the correct pin that you don't know, guess, and try various combinations you can recall.

To avoid forgetting your password or PIN next time, be sure to write the pattern or numbers on a text file or paper to keep them safe.

It is a professional tool that can remove all the fingerprints, pattern, and password lock screens without losing any data on your phone.
