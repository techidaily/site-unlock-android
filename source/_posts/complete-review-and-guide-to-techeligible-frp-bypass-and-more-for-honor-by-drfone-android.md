## How to Unlock a Network Locked Honor X9b Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Honor X9b phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Honor X9b device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Honor X9b network unlock** solutions.

## Pro Tips: Unlock Your Android Phones When You Forgot the Fingerprint

Setting a fingerprint lock or PIN, password, pattern, or even FRP lock on an Android phone is a common way to prevent our important data or private info from being prying eyes. However, if you forgot the fingerprint, or get your Android phone broken with a screen cracked, and enter the wrong password several times, you will be stuck on the problem and won’t be able to access your phone and all the apps on the Honor X9b device.
