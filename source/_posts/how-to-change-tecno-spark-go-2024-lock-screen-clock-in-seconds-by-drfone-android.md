## Bonus Part: Useful Tips to Prevent Future Lockouts on Android

Here are some helpful tips to prevent future lockouts on your Android device and ensure better password management.

- **1\. Use Password Managers**: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.
- **2\. Set up Biometric Authentication**: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.
- **3\. Create Memorable Passwords**: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.
- **4\. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.
- **5\. Regularly Back Up Your Data**: Make it a habit to consistently [back up your device data](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). To prevent potential data loss from forgotten passwords or unexpected issues, take precautions. Safeguard your crucial data by creating backups, whether in the cloud or on an external storage device.

## Conclusion

This article guided all the possible ways available in 2024 to reset your Android lock screen password, such as using the Smart Lock, Google Find My, Samsung SmartThings, and Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).
