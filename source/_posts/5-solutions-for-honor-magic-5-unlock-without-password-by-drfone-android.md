## Part 1: Lock System About Honor Magic 5  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Honor Magic 5  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Honor Magic 5  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Honor Magic 5  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Honor Magic 5  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Honor Magic 5  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Honor Magic 5  with Find My Device.

![disabling google smart lock feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-remove-or-disable-google-smart-lock-1.jpg)

## Part 1. Understanding Google Smart Lock and How It Works?

Want to know **what is Google Smart Lock**? [Google Smart Lock](https://get.google.com/smartlock/) serves as a multi-purpose tool within the Google ecosystem. It is designed to streamline security measures and password management access across platforms. At its core, Google Smart Lock operates as a feature that manages passwords. Google Smart Lock aims to enhance authentication processes. Primarily, it operates across Android devices and computers.

It offers a unified approach to security, ensuring you don’t have to remember all the passwords. Google Smart Lock securely stores and manages passwords for websites and apps. It enables users to access these services without repeatedly entering login details. When you visit a familiar website or app, Google Smart Lock fills in the login credentials. It automatically provides the login ID and password, maintaining effortless access.

## Part 2. Recognizing Some Top Features of Google Smart Lock

Google Smart Lock’s password management has revolutionized how users handle and secure their login credentials. It remains a cornerstone when handling Android devices and computer systems. The following are several notable features that significantly enhance user convenience and security:

### 1\. Password Autofill

Google Smart Lock simplifies the login process across apps and websites. It does that by automatically filling in saved credentials. This eliminates the need for users to remember and manually input passwords.

### 2\. Cross-Platform Synchronization

It synchronizes saved passwords across multiple devices using the same Google account. This ensures smooth access to credentials on Android devices and computers.

### 3\. Secure Storage

Passwords stored within Google Smart Lock are encrypted and securely stored in the user's Google account. This maintains confidentiality and safeguards sensitive login information.

### 4\. Effortless Password Generation

It allows the creation of strong and unique passwords when signing up for new accounts. That enhances overall account security and allows users to have strong passwords.

These features significantly ease the burden of password management and enhance user security. Yet, **Google Smart Lock** does have limitations that prompt some users to consider removing it.

### 4\. Preference for Third-Party Tools
