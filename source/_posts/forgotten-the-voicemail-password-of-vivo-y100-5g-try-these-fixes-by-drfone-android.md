Use the star code as follows:

- Type #793# into the dialer app on your phone.

## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Vivo Y100 5G 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Vivo Y100 5G device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like **RootJunky** can help you [<u>bypass FRP Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

![gently press fingerprint sensor](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-5.jpg)

### 2\. Device Showing Glitches

#### Problem

Glitches or software bugs in your Pixel device may cause disruptions. This can include issues with the fingerprint sensor's functionality. These problems can range from minor issues to severe software glitches.

#### Solution: Restart Your Pixel Device

One of the easiest and simplest solutions is to restart your Pixel phone. You can do that by pressing the "Power" and the "Volume Up" keys. It will lead to a pop-up power menu where you must choose "Restart" to reboot your device.

![restart google pixel device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-6.jpg)

### 3\. Outdated Firmware

#### Problem

An outdated operating system or firmware can lead to compatibility issues. This can lead to malfunctioning features like the **Pixel 6A fingerprint sensor not working**.

#### Solution: Check for Updates

The best way to resolve this issue is to update your Pixel device. Having an outdated version of Android OS can lead to an accumulation of bugs and glitches. Moreover, it can seriously affect the Vivo Y100 5G device's performance, causing many issues. Here is how to check and update your Pixel phone:

**Instructions.** On your Pixel device, access the “Settings” app. Within Settings, scroll down to tap the "System" option.

![update device to latest version](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-7.jpg)

### 4\. Dirty Phone or Sensor

#### Problem

Accumulated dirt, dust, or residue on the phone or fingerprint sensor can cause obstruction. This can lead to the failure to properly recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone

Employ a gentle, dry microfiber cloth for wiping down the complete surface of your Pixel device. Take particular care to thoroughly clean the region surrounding the fingerprint sensor. Refrain from utilizing rough substances or strong chemicals as they could potentially cause harm to the Vivo Y100 5G device.

![dirty sensor or phone issue](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-8.jpg)

Start by effectively cleaning the screen protector on your Pixel device. For a thorough cleaning, consider utilizing a screen cleaning solution. Ensure that the screen protector is free from any dirt or debris.

##### 2\. Replace Damaged Protectors

Is the screen protector visibly damaged, scratched, or peeling off? If yes, consider replacing it with a new one. Damaged protectors can hinder fingerprint recognition and compromise device protection.

##### 3\. Check Compatibility

Ensure the screen protector is designed to be compatible with fingerprint sensors. Some protectors may obstruct or interfere with the sensor's functionality.

![hold phone properly](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-11.jpg)

To do that, navigate to the Settings app and open it. Move to the "Display" window and scroll down to the last option. Toggle on the "Screen protector mode" to increase the screen sensitivity.

##### 2\. Finger Re-Enrollment

Delete existing fingerprints and re-register them. This re-enrollment can sometimes improve sensitivity and help remove the issues. Here is how you can delete and re-enroll your fingerprint:

- **Step 1.** In the Settings app of your Pixel, tap "Security & Privacy." Then, press "Device Unlock" and choose "Fingerprint Unlock." The device will now ask you to provide your device PIN or password.

- **Step 2.** Tap "Fingerprint Unlock" on the following screen and delete the previously enrolled fingerprints. Then, press "Add fingerprint" and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the process.

### 10\. Other Hardware Issues

#### Problem

Persistent fingerprint sensor problems might indicate underlying [hardware issues](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/best-apps-for-android-hardware-test.html). This could go beyond common troubleshooting and might require professional help.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Inspect for Physical Damage

Thoroughly examine your Pixel device for any physical damage. These include cracks, dents, or scratches around the fingerprint sensor area. Physical damage could affect the sensor's functionality.

##### 2\. Safe Mode Check

Boot the Vivo Y100 5G device in safe mode to determine if third-party apps are causing conflicts. To do that, press the "Power" key with any volume key to access the power menu. Afterward, long-press the "Power Off" option until the "Reboot to Safe Mode" option appears on your device's screen. Press "OK" to reboot into Safe Mode and test the fingerprint sensor's functionality.

##### 3\. Professional Assessment

If you suspect hardware issues, seek professional help from authorized service centers. A clear sign of hardware issues can be visible damage or the sensor failing to function even in safe mode.

### 11\. Factory Reset as Last Resort

#### Problem

Did all other troubleshooting methods fail to resolve persistent fingerprint sensor issues? Then, a [factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/android-factory-reset-code.html) might be required to revert the Vivo Y100 5G device to its original settings.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Backup Data

Before initiating a factory reset, ensure that all crucial data is safeguarded. This encompasses contacts, photos, documents, and any other significant files. Use Google's backup services or third-party apps to securely [back up your data](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/).

##### 2\. Initiating Factory Reset

Proceed with the following steps to execute a factory reset on your Pixel device:

- **Step 1.** On your Pixel smartphone, navigate to Settings and access the "System" tab. Here, scroll down to the bottom and tap "Reset Options."

![head to system settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-17.jpg)
