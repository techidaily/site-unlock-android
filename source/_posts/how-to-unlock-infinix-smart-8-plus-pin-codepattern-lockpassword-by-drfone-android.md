PRECAUTION:  At best, this can be the first level of security, as one who resembles you to some extent can unlock the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device. Photographs are not stored in the system. The device does hold necessary data to recognize your face, and the security level is determined by how good the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device is configured. The data is not accessed by any app or loaded onto a Google server for backup.

_Setting Up Trusted Face_
