## Part 1: Lock System About Itel S23  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Itel S23  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Itel S23  is one of the older versions of Itel  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Itel S23  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Itel S23  with its privacy password settings.

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Itel S23  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Itel S23  with Find My Device.
