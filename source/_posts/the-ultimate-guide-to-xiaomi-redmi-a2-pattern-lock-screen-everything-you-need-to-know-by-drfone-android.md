- 8\. Furthermore, you need to confirm your choice and provide the same pattern once again. Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.
- 9\. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well. In case if you will forget your pattern, then you can access your phone by taking the assistance of this pin.
