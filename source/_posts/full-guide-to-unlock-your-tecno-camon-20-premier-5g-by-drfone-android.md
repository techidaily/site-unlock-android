## Method 8. Other Methods

- Step 1. Take your friend's phone to call on your locked phone.
- Step 2. Accept the call and press the back button without disconnecting.
- Step 3. Now you can access the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device completely
- Step 4. Go to the security settings of the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device and remove the pattern or pin.
- Step 5. It will ask you the correct pin that you don't know, guess, and try various combinations you can recall.

To avoid forgetting your password or PIN next time, be sure to write the pattern or numbers on a text file or paper to keep them safe.
