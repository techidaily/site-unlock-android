## How to Remove Operator Lock on Itel A60s ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider.

If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Itel A60s  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Itel A60s :
