## Method 1: Unlock Itel P55 5G  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern. Since these may also be easily guessed by people who are in possession of your device illegally, Google deprecated this method after Android 4.4. However, the phones running Android 4.4 or lower are still allowed to be unlocked using this method. So, if you have an old Itel P55 5G  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Itel P55 5G  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Itel P55 5G  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

![unlock motorola phone with security questions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/full-guide-to-unlock-motorola-phones-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** Next, choose the option to reset the pattern by answering your Google credentials.

**Step 3:** Sign into the Google account that matches with the Google account on the phone.

**Step 4:** Lastly, create a new pattern to unlock your Itel P55 5G  phone.

### Side Tip

It makes sense given that our phones hold a substantially large part of our personal and professional lives these days. And we are not even talking about features that you may or may not need - we are talking only from a data security point of view.

## Method 3: Factory Reset Itel P55 5G  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Itel P55 5G  phone to allow users to erase the Itel P55 5G device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box. Naturally, this is not a preferred way, as it requires the phone to be set up all over again and that takes time. Also, all data will need to be backed up beforehand in order to restore it again.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

**Step 2:** Log in and go to Security > Your Devices:

![unlock motorola phone with google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/full-guide-to-unlock-motorola-phones-10.jpg)

**Step 5:** Click Erase Device and confirm.

**Step 6:** After the erasure, your device will need to be set up all over again.

## Method 5: Request Service Provider To Unlock Your Itel P55 5G  Phone

If your Itel P55 5G  phone is tied to a service contract and you want to unlock your device to use it with other service providers, this method is for you. You can request your service provider to unlock your Itel P55 5G  phone provided their conditions are met. Usually, they will be happy to oblige if there are no dues and the service period is over.

## Bonus Tip: If You Want To Disable Screen Lock

Sometimes, you may not need to secure your device at all. For example, if you have an old device that you want to use as a media player in your car or to give to children to play games, you may not want to password-protect the Itel P55 5G device. This is how to disable screen lock on Android:

**Step 1:** Navigate to Settings > Security > Screen Lock.

**Step 2:** Enter the PIN or pattern.

**Step 3:** Choose None and confirm.

### Conclusion

There are a handful of methods you can use to unlock a Itel P55 5G  phone in case you forget the password or PIN or pattern. Especially for the old pattern-based screen locks, it is easy to unlock the phone if you know the answers to the security questions in your Google account. However, to unlock Itel P55 5G  phone screen without password on newer Android versions, you need technical knowledge, or you can use third-party software such as Wondershare Dr.Fone.

## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Itel P55 5G 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Itel P55 5G device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like **RootJunky** can help you [<u>bypass FRP Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

## Unlocking the Power of Smart Lock: A Beginner's Guide for Itel P55 5G Users

Google constantly comes up with features to simplify the way users interact and complete tasks on the Android platform. One of the most important features that techies loved to debate about was the Smart Lock Android, a secure password manager functioning in sync with a Google account on the Android phone.

## Part 1: What is Android Smart Lock?

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162221345.jpg)

Android Lollipop added a feature called Smart Lock, and the feature was devised as a smart tool to prevent the Android phone from locking once it was initially unlocked. In other words, the feature overrides an Android phone's Lock Screen feature, thereby saving users the need to enter passwords every time the Itel P55 5G device locks.

If you're at home, it's likely your android phone is locked out if you haven't accessed at for some time. Smart Locks solves the problem in many ways. It allows you to allocate trusted places. Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won't lock. Trusted devices come next. Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162911081.jpg)

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555165271526.jpg)

Finally, trusted face unlocking is the ultimate face recognition system that unlocks your Android device as soon as you look at it across the front-facing camera. A face unlock first introduced with Android Jelly Bean and has been significantly improved in later versions.

_Turning On Smart Lock_

The feature is enabled by first accessing settings. For example, in a Samsung Galaxy S6:

- • Here, you need to enter your Screen Lock. If you haven't done so, set up a password and PIN by following the on-screen prompts. The screen Lock is needed every time you have to change the Smart Lock settings.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555175242280.jpg)

Within Smart Lock, there are three options for setting the system. You can set up trusted devices, trusted face, and trusted places individually, combining two or all three at the same time. You can choose just one trusted face, but you have the option to set up as many trusted devices and trusted places as needed.

## Part 2: Turn On Smart Lock For Android with Trusted Devices
