## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Vivo G2 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions.

The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Vivo G2 device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.
