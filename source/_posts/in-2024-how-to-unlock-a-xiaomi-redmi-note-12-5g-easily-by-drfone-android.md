- **Step 2:** Go to the Android SIM unlock provider’s website and enter your device’s IMEI number.

By following these steps, you can successfully unlock the SIM of your Xiaomi device, ensuring you can enjoy your phone with the carrier of your choice, wherever your travels may take you.

### Important Considerations

Remember, unlocking the SIM doesn’t absolve you from your carrier contract. You’re still obligated to make timely payments as per your agreement.
