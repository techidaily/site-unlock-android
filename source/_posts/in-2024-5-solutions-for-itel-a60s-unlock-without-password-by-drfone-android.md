## Part 1: Lock System About Itel A60s  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Itel A60s  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Itel A60s  is one of the older versions of Itel  android phones that was released in 2016.

With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Itel A60s  with Find My Device.
