This method of unlocking your lock screen needs your Android device to snap a photo of your with its camera. After you set the snapped photo as the unlocking recognition, you could unlock your device through showing your face on the screen.

Capture a picture of your face with your Android device's camera and then set it for logging in into your device. From the lock screen, by just by holding your face, you can log in. It's very interesting, but you should never rely on this method for strong security as this method of unlocking is prone to break easily as an intruder can unlock your device by putting a photo of you in front of your device. Moreover, this method sometimes doesn't work properly. So it's better to go for some other highly secured options for locking your screen.

### 3.Pattern

This is a way of setting pattern for lock screen from a grid of nine dots. You can select the pattern like some letter like Z, L or C etc, but nothing guarantees high security as the set pattern can be easily guessed or be seen while you are unlocking your device. Another problem is that by unlocking with the same pattern, your finger leaves some marks for the pattern's path. By following the path, a stranger can unlock your device. So for little security, you can use pattern unlock method on your Android device.

![android lock screen settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-5.jpg)

Go to the lock screen setting for Pattern and then set the pattern by sliding your finger from one dot to another, then another and like that way. Remember which pattern you've set in order to unlock your device in the next time.

### 4.PIN

You might be troubled by thinking about the difference between PIN and Password. A little distinction is there for a PIN and that is it consists of numbers only whereas for password, you can associate some alphabetical letters or signs along with numbers.

![android lock screen settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-6.jpg)

Go to the lock screen setting for PIN and then set a PIN that consists of minimum 4 digits. It's your choice to use 4 or more digit PIN. After setting the PIN, you can access your Android device by putting the PIN in a box from the lock screen. PIN protected lock screen is highly protected if the PIN is set strongly.

### 5.Password

In addition to PIN protection, you can consider it as password by adding some letters, special characters with the previously selected PIN codes. It's also very much highly protected method of locking screen though you might be bored with tapping for the password again and again. But never ignore the value of your device's files, so a password can be a well-sought lock screen protection for many users.

### 6.Fingerprint

In some of the modern Android device, you'll find the feature of fingerprint unlocking. You can find the option through the screen or any dedicated button. By setting your fingerprint, you can unlock your device by tapping your finger on the Vivo Y100i Power 5G device's screen or the dedicated button.

![android lock screen settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-9.jpg)

Go to the setting from "Voice Unlock" button and record your voice such as "Open My Vivo Y100i Power 5G" or as per your choice with clear sound. Repeat the voice a few more times as to match well. Then set and unlock your device from the lock screen by using the same voice command.
