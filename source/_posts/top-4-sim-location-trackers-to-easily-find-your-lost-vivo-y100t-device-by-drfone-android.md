- **Step 3:** Select Screen Lock Type.
- **Step 4:** Select the Password option.
- **Step 5:** Enter your current password, then tap Continue.
- **Step 6:** Enter your new password twice, then tap OK.
- **Step 7:** Your new password will now be in effect.

### 3\. Don’t you have face or fingerprint unlock? Let’s set them up.  

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings app on your Samsung phone.
- **Step 2:** Tap on the "Lock Screen" option.
- **Step 3:** Select "Screen Lock Type."
- **Step 4:** Choose the "Fingerprints" or "Face unlock" option.
- **Step 5:** Follow the instructions on your screen to set up the desired unlock feature.
- **Step 6:** When you're finished, you'll be able to unlock your phone using either your fingerprint or your face.

### 4\. How to unlock an Android phone without data loss?

There are several ways how to [unlock Android phones without data loss](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/android-lock-screen-removal.html). One of the most recommended ways is that you can set up the method to unlock with a fingerprint or face. Because it has an official guarantee, and you don’t need professional skills. Moreover, if your phone has Android version 4.0 or even older, unlocking your phone via "Forgot Pattern' will also help you finish the goal.

The methods discussed above in Way 1 or [Way 2](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/forgot-android-password.html#Part2) can guide you better into unlocking your device using this tool.
