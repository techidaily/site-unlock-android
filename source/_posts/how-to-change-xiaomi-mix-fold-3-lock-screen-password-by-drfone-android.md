## How To Change Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 Lock Screen Password?

Setting up a lock screen is a crucial step in protecting your phone's data. If you're not sure how to create one on your Android™ phone, we're here to help.

Your Android lock screen pin or password and your Google Account password are two passwords you use frequently. Keeping a good lock screen passcode is important.

Although you might not frequently enter your lock screen pin or password if you use a biometric unlocking method like fingerprint or facial recognition, it's still important to be familiar with it.

You'll need to reset your Google Account password if you forget it or become locked out for some other reason when you try to keep accessing all of your data. You might also need to change lock screen passcode from time to time.

![lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-change-lock-screen-password-1.jpg)


## How to Change/Set up Lock Screen Password

Select Screen Lock Type under Settings > Lock Screen. From there, you may select from a variety of lock screen options:

![how to set up password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-change-lock-screen-password-2.jpg)

**Swipe:** This lock type allows you to swipe in any direction on your screen to unlock your phone.

**Pattern:** If you opt to unlock your phone in this manner, you must create a pattern on a 3-by-3-dot grid.

**Pin:** A PIN lock is a four-digit code. Make sure you select a set of numbers that you can quickly recall.

**Password:** Your phone's highest level of security. Your password must be distinct, easily remembered, and include at least one letter and 7 characters.

Follow the setup instructions on-screen after selecting the security measure you prefer.

Additionally, you'll notice options to enable fingerprint or face biometric recognition features. Iris Scanner (S8/S8+) or Intelligent Scan (S9/S9+) may also be available on some older Samsung® models.

**Face recognition:** By holding your face directly in front of your phone's screen, you may unlock your phone and authenticate yourself in apps.

With fingerprints, you can quickly touch your finger to unlock your phone.

**Iris:** Check your eyes to make sure that only you can see the contents of your phone.

**Intelligent Scan:** A method of device unlocking that combines face and iris recognition technology.

Follow on-screen instructions if you decide to employ one of these sophisticated security technologies, or go to Settings > Biometrics and security for more customization choices.
