Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization.

Here are the steps for **Infinix Note 30i  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Infinix Note 30i  with the power button.
