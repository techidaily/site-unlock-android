## Part 1: How To Track Your Vivo Y36i on Google Earth

This **Google Maps IMEI number tracking** issue has caused quite a buzz and controversy on the internet. It has raised many concerns regarding the safety and privacy of every smartphone user. To tell you the truth, Google Earth lacks IMEI location data and does not provide such capabilities. Thus, there is no truth in **tracking IMEI numbers through Google Earth**.

### How To Locate a Smartphone Using Google Earth

Many current smartphones include GPS receivers that allow them to pinpoint their exact location. If you know the phone's GPS coordinates, you can plug them into Google Earth to see where it is on the map.

- **Step 1:** This process won't be possible if your location services are not enabled on your phone. To do this, navigate to **Settings,** then **Location** on Android, and **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Location Services** on iOS.

![iphone location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-02.jpg)
