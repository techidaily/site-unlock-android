## Part 3: A Comprehensive Comparison: Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) vs. Android Multi Tool

Well, you have come to know great things about the two pattern lock remover tools: Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock and Android Multi Tool.

Now, take a look at these tools' comparison.

| **Features** | **Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) ![hot icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/hot-tip.png)**  | **Android Multi Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unlock pattern locks without deleting data | Yes | Yes |
| Easy to use | Yes | Technical skills required. |
| High-success Rate | Yes | This tool may sometimes not work.  |

One of the standout features of [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) is its simplicity. The software is designed to be easy to use, even for those with little technical knowledge.

One key advantage of Android Multi Tool is its compatibility with a wide range of Android devices. However, it's worth noting that due to its open-source nature, Android Multi Tool may not receive regular updates and bug fixes, which could potentially lead to compatibility issues with newer Android versions.

In terms of customer support, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) excels.
