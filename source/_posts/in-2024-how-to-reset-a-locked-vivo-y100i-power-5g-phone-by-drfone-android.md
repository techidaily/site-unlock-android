## Part 3: In What Cases Should We Remove PIN On Our Android Phone?

There are a few reasons why you might want to remove the phone PIN from your Android:

### 1\. Failed Attempts

If you've tried to unlock your phone with a pin too many times and failed, your phone will become locked. In this case, you'll need to remove the PIN to unlock it.

### 2\. Buy a Used Android phone

When you buy a second-hand Android phone, it's best to remove the previous owner's pin for security reasons. You can enter the phone's settings and remove the PIN under the security section.

### The Bottom Line

It can be frustrating when you forget your screen lock pin. You're stuck staring at your phone, unable to use it or access any of your important data. But don't worry; there are a few ways you can try to remove the screen lock pin on your Android device.

Luckily, Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock is a powerful and easy-to-use lock screen removal tool that can help you bypass your lock screen in just a few minutes. Plus, it's compatible with a wide range of Android devices, so you can use it regardless of what type of phone you have.
