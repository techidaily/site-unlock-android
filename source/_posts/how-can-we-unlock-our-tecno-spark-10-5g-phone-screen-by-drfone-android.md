**Step 2:** Click "Erase my device," which you will see on the left half of your screen. After affirming the Delete capability, your phone will boot into recovery and begin playing out a production line reset. It is difficult to stop or drop on your android gadget when you endorse this activity. Regardless of whether you shut down your Android phone - the reboot will continue on startup.

### 2\. Recovery Mode

Depending on your phone, the steps for this process might vary a little. Most phones will allow you to reset by getting to the recovery mode. Follow the steps below to remove the **Android screen lock:**

- update system set value=0 where name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';
- .quit

After you've finished this, reboot your Android phone. If this doesn't reset your lock screen, proceed to the following stage.

With your Android phone connected and the cmd opens, enter:

**Step 1.** Go to [Minimal ADB and Fastboot](https://androidmtk.com/download-minimal-adb-and-fastboot-tool) download page.

![Minimal adb and fastboot installation complete](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313566582.jpg)

**Step 4.** Make sure your device is connected, then go to the Minimal ADB and Fastboot installation directory.

This PC \[Win 8& 10\] or My computer \[Windows 7 & below\]> Local Disk (C:) \[primary drive\]> Program Files \[for 32-bit\] or Program Files (x86) \[for 64-bit\] > Minimal ADB and Fasboot.

![Local Disk](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313589887.jpg)

![Program Files (x86) folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313591963.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313625020.jpg)

**Step 5.** Inside the folder, hold the Shift key on your keyboard, then right-click your mouse. An additional "Open command window here" will appear so select that.

![Minimal adb and fastboot open command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313653169.jpg)

**Step 6.** ADB terminal will pop out. Now, the first is to type in ADB _devices_. This is to check if your device is recognized by ADB. If there is no device listed below, try to remove and reconnect your Tecno Spark 10 5G and retype the command. If there are listed devices already, proceed.

![Minimal adb and fastboot command window adb devices command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317691463.jpg)

- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';_
- _.quit_

![Minimal adb and fastboot adb shell command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317729484.jpg)

This would work if you have your USB debugging turned on before it was locked. That's how to unlock Android using ADB.

## Part 4: How to Unlock Phone via Find My Device (with Data Loss)

## Tips and Tricks for Setting Up your Tecno Spark 10 5G Phone Pattern Lock

Failing to remember the **pattern lock** of a phone is one of the most puzzling situations for Android users. Unlike the famous OS, Android gives a seamless method to eliminate the issue.

You can attempt the methods below or an expert tool if you have forgotten the **pattern lock** on your gadget and reset it.

**Step 6.** Affirm your decision and set another **pattern lock** on your phone.

### 3\. Emergency Call Trick (For Android 5 or 5.1.1)

**Step 1:** Tap the Emergency Call button and enter ten asterisks (\*).

**Step 2:** Copy and paste the asterisks on the dialer until you no longer see the paste choice.

**Step 3:** Return to the lock screen and tap on the camera symbol.

**Step 4:** Press the settings choice on your Android gadget after pulling down the notification tray. Now you will have the chance to enter the PIN/password, and you ought to continue unlocking your Android phone. Continue to paste until the lock screen UI crashes.

### 4\. Safe Mode Boot (For Android 4.1 or later)

**Step 1:** You can bring up the power menu and hold the "Power Off" button for most phones, especially Android phones. A warning will spring up, asking whether you might want to Reboot to Safe Mode. Here, it would help if you had to press Ok.

**Step 2:** Clear your lock screen application's data.

Clean data off your lock screen app, uninstall it, and then reboot your device to escape safe mode. When you do so, your phone or Android device will unlock.

### 5\. Use ADB (USB required for Android 10 and lower)

- Connect your device to your PC using a USB connector.
- On your PC, open a terminal window (or command prompt).
- Type in the commands given below. Press Enter after each line:

adb shell

album/data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases

sqlite3 settings.db

update system set value=0 where name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';

update system set value=0 where name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';

.quit

exit

adb reboot

- After your gadget has rebooted, enter the command below:

adb shell

rm/data/framework/gesture.key

exit

adb reboot

- Your phone will reboot. After it reboots and requests a security pattern, you can utilize any pattern, and it will unlock.

### Conclusion

This guide provides insight into the most common Android issue. Here, we have discussed different techniques to bypass the **pattern lock** on your Android phone. However, we suggest you go for a professional tool while carrying this out. Therefore, you should choose an expert tool like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock to open the **lock screen pattern**.
